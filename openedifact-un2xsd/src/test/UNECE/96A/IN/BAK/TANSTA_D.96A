General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Tank status
       report message (TANSTA) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       A message from a vessel to the shipplanning department of a
       shipping line and vice versa (e.g. via satellite), giving
       details about the contents of ballast tanks, fuel tanks, water
       tanks and other figures necessary for the calculation of the
       stability of the vessel.

1.2    Field of Application

       The Tank status report message may be used for both national
       and international trade. It is based on universal commercial
       practice and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       This message serves to transmit information about all non-cargo
       deadweight items on board a vessel. This includes all ballast
       and service tanks, stores, crew and effects and other
       miscellaneous items including deadweight constants.
       
       The message can be used for transmission of either current or
       forecast status of tank and deadweight items. For example, the
       message may be used to transmit information relating to an
       actual departure condition from one port but can also be used
       to transmit data relating to a forecast arrival condition at
       another port.
       
       In general, the message will be generated on board by the
       ship's operator and transmitted to other parties interested in
       the vessel's stability and safety. This is normally the
       operations or tonnage centre but may also be a third party such
       as a terminal operator.
       
       In certain circumstances the message can also be transmitted to
       the vessel. In this case the contents of the message may be
       used to advise the ship's master of a desirable arrival
       condition.
