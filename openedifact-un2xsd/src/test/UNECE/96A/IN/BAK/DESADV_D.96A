0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Despatch
       advice message (DESADV) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

       This paper provides the definition of the United Nations
       Standard Despatch Advice message to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners.

1.1    Functional Definition

       A message specifying details for goods despatched or ready for
       despatch under agreed conditions.
       
       The United Nations Despatch Advice Message serves both as a
       specification for Delivery Despatch Advice and also as a
       Returns Despatch Advice message. Throughout this document, the
       reference to 'Despatch Advice' may be interpreted as conveying
       the wider meaning of 'Delivery Despatch Advice/Returns Despatch
       Advice'.

1.2    Field of Application

       The UN Standard Despatch Advice Message may be applied for both
       national and international trade. It is based on universal
       commercial practice and is not dependent on the type of
       business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The message intent is to advise of the detailed contents of a
       consignment.
       
       The message relates to one seller and one buyer or their
       respective agents.
       
       The message relates to a single despatch point and single or
       multiple destination points. It may cover a number of different
       items or packages.
       
       It allows the recipient to:
       
        - know when the material has been despatched or will be ready
       for despatch
       
        - have the precise details of the consignment 
        
        - take initial steps towards Customs clearance in the case of
       international consignments
       
       - enable matching between despatched goods and the following
       invoice.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Data Segment Clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the Branching
       Diagram and the Segment Table which indicate mandatory,
       conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole
       message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and
       implementation of the message:
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format
       'yymmdd'/'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction
       agree that there is a functional requirement for an alternative
       format. Periods should be specified as whole numbers
       representing the required period as indicated in the format
       qualifier (weeks, months, etc.).
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should be
       omitted.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent
       segments does not conflict with the segment qualifier of the
       trigger segment of a group.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as
       this inhibits automatic processing.
