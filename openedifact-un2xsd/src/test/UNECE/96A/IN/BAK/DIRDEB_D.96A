General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Direct debit
       message (DIRDEB) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration,
       commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       Prior to the Direct Debit procedure, some agreement(s) would
       usually have been concluded : 
       
       - agreement between the Creditor and his Bank (mainly to
       specify the conditions of credit and the kind of direct debit).
       
       - agreement between the Debtor and the Debtor's Bank (i.e.
       pre-authorization and condition of debit), or between the
       Creditor and the Debtor.
       
       A Direct Debit is sent by the Creditor to the Creditor's Bank
       instructing it to claim specified amount(s) from the Debtor(s)
       and to credit the amount(s) to an account specified in the
       message, which the Creditor's Bank services for the Creditor in
       settlement of the referenced transaction(s).
       
       Throughout this document the term 'Creditor' refers to either a
       Beneficiary or a Payee, likewise the term 'Debtor' refers to
       either an Ordering Customer or a Payor.
       
       The term 'Bank' may be interpreted as any financial
       institution.
       
       The term 'pre-authorization' refers to an agreement between a
       Creditor and a Debtor for
       
       - either automatic debiting, as required,
       
       - or for debiting unless rejected by the debtor in a period of
       time.
       
       The agreement can also be made between the debtor and his bank,
       independently of the amount of the DIRDEB.

1.2    Field of Application

       This message type may be applied, for both national and
       international settlements, but it is based on the national
       existing rules of the debit side.

1.3    Principles

       - A Direct Debit may cover the financial settlement(s) of one
       or more commercial trade transactions, such as invoices, credit
       notes, debit notes, etc. It is not intended for use in
       securities trading.
       
       - Several credit accounts, execution dates and currencies may
       be specified.
       
       - Charges may be borne on account(s) different of the
       account(s) held by the Creditor.
       
       - The Creditor's Bank may need a confirmation/authorization
       (AUTHOR) from the creditor to be able to process the Direct
       Debit Message.
       
       - Pre-authorized and non pre-authorized direct debits shall not
       be mixed within the same message.
       
       - The only way to modify a Direct Debit message is to cancel
       the whole message or a transaction thereof (e.g. by the use of
       the FINCAN message). In that respect, one to many order(s)
       could be cancelled within the message, avoiding to be obliged
       to cancel the whole message.
       
       The cancellation of a message can only be effected by the
       originator of the message. The kind of cancellation is
       dependent upon the process of the message or a transaction of
       it.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Data Segment Clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the Branching
       Diagram and the Segment Table which indicate mandatory,
       conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following semantic principles applying to the message are
       intended to facilitate the understanding of the message:
       
       The Direct Debit message is structured in three levels: A, B
       and C.
       
          - Level A contains general data related to the whole message
       and is contained in Segment Groups 1, 2, 3 and 24.
       
          - Level B contains data from the credit side (one credit
       account, one currency, one execution day) and data which
       applies to all the dependent C levels and is contained in
       Segment Group 4 through Segment Group 10.
       
          - Level C contains mainly data related to the debit side
       and, may contain remittance information. This data is
       considered as unique for each debit transaction and is
       contained in Segment Group 11 through Segment Group 23.
       
       The structure of the message is designed to allow several B
       levels, each B level being followed by its related C levels.
