0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Direct
       balance of payment declaration message (BOPDIR) to be used in
       Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners
       involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       The message can be sent by non-bank residents to report
       directly to the Balance of Payments (BOP) compiler on: 
       
       . transactions via bank accounts held at a resident bank 
       . transactions via bank accounts held at a non-resident bank 
       . transactions and clearing via accounts with non-bank
       non-residents 
       . foreign assets and liabilities 
       . information in the context of a BOP-related survey (stocks
       and flows); for those countries which base their compilation of
       the BOP on surveys.

1.2    Field of Application

       This message is to be applied in the framework of the data
       collection for the Balance of Payment compilation.

1.3    Principles

       The message , which contains 3 parts, is sent by enterprises
       (non-banks) to the BOP compiler to supply information on
       amounts received from non-residents via resident banks. This is
       an alternative route to sending a BOPINF message. Or, as is the
       case in France, to report on all their transactions, payments
       and receipts.
       
       This part deals with part 1 of the message.
       
       This message could also be used for reporting on settlements
       via external bank accounts, current accounts held abroad with
       non-banks or participation in an international clearing system.
       
       This part deals with part 2 of the message.
       
       Further, this message could also be used for reporting results
       for all types of BOP-related surveys : either for reporting
       results of general questionnaires or for specific
       questionnaires such as the reports on positions (foreign assets
       and liabilities) 
       
       This part deals with part 3 of the message.
       
       Each part is independent from each other. A message can contain
       one, two or all of them.
