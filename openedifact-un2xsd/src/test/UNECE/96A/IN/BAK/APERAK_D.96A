General Introduction
----------------------------------------------------------------------



0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Application
       error and acknowledgement message (APERAK) to be used in
       Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners
       involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       The function of this message is: 
       a)  to inform a message issuer that his message has been
       received by the addressee's application and has been rejected
       due to errors encountered during its processing in the
       application.
       b)  to acknowledge to a message issuer the receipt of his
       message by the addressee's application.

1.2    Field of Application

       The Application error and acknowledgement message may be used
       for both national and international trade. It is based on
       universal commercial practice and is not dependent on the type
       of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       A message being first controlled at system level (CONTRL) to
       detect syntax errors and to acknowledge its receipt is then
       transmitted to the application process to be processed.
        
       If an error is detected at the application level, which
       prevents its complete processing, an APERAK message is sent to
       the original message issuer giving details of the error(s)
       encountered.
       If no error has been detected and when an acknowledgement is
       necessary (when no dedicated answer to the original message
       exists) an APERAK message is sent precising the reasons of
       acknowledgement.
       In case of application error, the APERAK message will need
       manual processing e.g. when the underlying reason is a
       programming error.
       
       In case of acknowledgement the APERAK message may be
       automatically or manually processed at recipient's discretion.

          A group of segments to specify the functional entity
          reference (e.g. goods item level, equipment level) relating
