0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Payroll
       deductions advice message (PAYDUC) to be used in Electronic
       Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       The Payroll Deductions Advice is sent by a party (usually an
       employer or its representative) to a service providing
       organisation, to detail payments by payroll deductions, on
       behalf of employees, made to the service providing
       organisation.

1.2    Field of Application

       This message may be applied for both national and international
       payment advices where payment is through payroll deductions. It
       is based on general commercial practice and is not dependent on
       the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       - a Payroll Deductions Advice gives detailed information about
       a payment.
       
       - the payment is on behalf of one or more employees.
       
       - the payment may be for multiple services.
       
       - the payment may refer to multiple dates.
       
       - commission amounts may be deducted from gross payments.
       
       - a Payroll Deductions Advice is based on agreements between
       the parties.
       
       - the message allows for the transmission in the details
       section of either complete information of individual employee
       payments, or only the information regarding changes from
       nominated regular payments.
