General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the International
       multimodal status request message (IFTSTQ) to be used in
       Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners
       involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       A message to request an International multimodal status report
       message (IFTSTA) in order to provide details relating to
       transport status and/or a change in the transport status
       between agreed parties.

1.2    Field of Application

       The International multimodal status request message may be used
       for both national and international trade. It is based on
       universal commercial practice and is not dependent on the type
       of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       This message allows for the request of information regarding
       the status of the physical movement of consignments, goods, or
       equipment at any point (in time or place) within the full
       transport chain.
       
       The request for status can be made by either:
       
       a) using the top level segments to request information about
       one or a number of consignments relating to a point or period
       of time, location(s), party related reference(s) and party(s),
       means of transport(s) and equipment(s).
       
       b) using the CNI segment group and making reference to a unique
       consignment reference number per consignment and indicating, if
       necessary, the criteria (date(s), location(s), etc.) for which
       the status is requested.
       
       APPROACHES a) AND b) MUST NOT BE USED TOGETHER WITHIN 
       ONE IFTSTQ MESSAGE.
       
       Data requirements for tracking equipment, where equipment is
       not associated with a consignment (such as repair container),
       are not addressed in this message.
