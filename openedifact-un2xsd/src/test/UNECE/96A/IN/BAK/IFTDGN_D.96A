General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Dangerous
       goods notification message (IFTDGN) to be used in Electronic
       Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       The International Forwarding and Transport Dangerous Goods
       Notification message is a message from the party responsible to
       declare the dangerous goods (e.g. carrier's agent, freight
       forwarder) to the party acting on behalf of the local authority
       performing the checks on conformance with the legal
       requirements on the control of dangerous goods, normally Port
       Authority, conveying the information relating to one
       conveyance/voyage of a means of transport such as a vessel,
       train, truck or barge, on the dangerous goods being loaded,
       unloaded, and/or in transit.

1.2    Field of Application

       The Dangerous goods notification message may be used for both
       national and international trade. It is based on universal
       commercial practice and is not dependent on the type of
       business or industry.

1.3  | Principles

       This message is meant to comply with the legal requirements of
       authorities concerning the notification/declaration of
       dangerous goods.
       
       1- One message relates to one conveyance/voyage of a means of
       transport.
       Remark: the message structure is aligned with the IFCSUM
       message (Forwarding and consolidation summary message).
       
       2- One message is to be suitable to declare both the dangerous
       goods to be discharged and loaded and the dangerous goods that
       remain on board (in transit). Only one handling operation per
       IFTDGN message can be reported, or a handling operation can be
       specified per consignment in IFTDGN.
       
       3- One message may relate to all dangerous goods information
       that the sender of the message is responsible for or to a
       certain part of that information; the information may be split
       in different messages, e.g. as it known at different times or
       the discharging information is sent separately from loading
       information or the information is split up in different
       messages for the different dangerous goods classes.
       
       4- One message is to be based on the local legal information
       requirements regarding the notification of dangerous goods to
       the (port) authority.
       N.B. This may mean that in a certain port the condition for a
       data element (or qualifier) that is conditional according to
       this specification, is that the data element (or qualifier)
       becomes mandatory for that port.
       
       5- A dangerous goods notification message may contain several
       consignments.
       
       6- A consignment may contain several goods items/dangerous
       goods classes.
       
       7- Each goods item can only contain one dangerous goods class.
       A goods item reflects the operational description of the goods.
       
       8- A dangerous goods class may be transported in one or more
       equipment, and a single equipment may contain one or more
       dangerous goods classes.
       
       9- The message has to cater for the provision of sending
       updates (change, deletion or cancellation).
       
       Remark: To cover all dangerous goods information relating to
       one conveyance/voyage of a means of transport might imply
       accumulation of several Dangerous Goods Notification messages
       from the same or several agents/forwarders.
       
       The Dangerous Goods Acknowledgement message is a message from
       the party acting on behalf of the local authority to the party
       responsible to declare the dangerous goods.
       
       Agent                                                Port
