General Introduction
----------------------------------------------------------------------



0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Worker's
       insurance history message (SSRECH) to be used in Electronic
       Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       The SSRECH message is sent by a designated body in one State to
       the equivalent body in another State giving details of a
       worker's Social Security insurance history as requested by the
       latter State.

1.2    Field of Application

       The Worker's insurance history message may be used for both
       national and international trade. It is based on universal
       commercial practice and is not dependent on the type of
       business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       When an institution receives from a foreign institution a
       message SSREGW requesting details of a worker's Social Security
       insurance history, it answers to this request sending a SSRECH
       message. This message gives for each period of insurance the
       scheme, nature and type of the period (if relevant), the dates
       related to the period and, eventually, the employment and
       employer during this period.
