General Introduction
----------------------------------------------------------------------



0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Job
       information demand message (JINFDE) to be used in Electronic
       Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       A message sent by a governmental agency to an employer in
       response to a work grant request. This message asks for
       specific additional information (e.g. visa) for further
       processing of the work grant request.

1.2    Field of Application

       The Job information demand message may be used for both
       national and international trade. It is based on universal
       commercial practice and is not dependent on the type of
       business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The message is designed to request additional information about
       a person and/or a job (e.g. specific documents) for further
       processing of a work grant or permit request.
       
       A Job Information Demand Message is transmitted from a
       governmental agency to an employer.
       
       A Job Information Demand Message may contain detailed
       information about a person and/or the required missing
       documents.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Data Segment Clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the Branching
       Diagram and the Segment Table which indicate mandatory,
       conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole
       message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and
       implementation of the message:
       
       All specified dates and times should be in the format 'yymmdd'
       or 'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction agree
       that there is a functional requirement for an alternative
       format. Periods should be specified as whole numbers
       representing the required period as indicated in the format
       qualifier (weeks, months, etc.)
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not
       be included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent
       segments does not conflict with the segment qualifier of the
       trigger segment of a group.

4.1.1  Header section

       Information to be provided in the Header section:

0010 | UNH, Message header
       A service segment starting and uniquely identifying a message.
       The message type code for the Job information demand message is
       JINFDE.
       
       Note: Job information demand messages conforming to this
       document must contain the following data in segment UNH,
       composite S009:

       Data element  0065 JINFDE
                     0052 D
                     0054 96A
                     0051 UN

0020   BGM, Beginning of message
       A segment by which the sender must uniquely identify the demand
       of job information by means of its type and number and, when
       necessary, its function.

0030   DTM, Date/time/period
       A segment specifying general dates and, when relevant, times
       related to the whole message. The segment must be specified at
       least once to identify the document date. The Date/time/period
       segment within other Segment groups should be used whenever the
       date or time or period requires to be logically related to
       another specified data item.

          and the job administration parties is mandatory for the Job
          Information Demand Message. It is recommended that, where
          possible, only the coded form of the party identification
          should be specified, e.g. where the enterprise and the job
          administration are known to each other, thus only the coded
          identification is required, but a job center or a job
          application address (interview) may vary and would have to
          be clearly specified, preferably in structured format.

0070      LOC, Place/location identification

       A group of segments for giving references and, where necessary,
       their dates, relating to the whole message.
