General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Quality data
       message (QALITY) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration,
       commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       A message to enable the transmission of the results of tests
       performed to satisfy a specified product or process
       requirement. The content includes, but is not limited to, test
       data and measurements, statistical information, and the testing
       methods employed.

1.2    Field of Application

       The UN Standard Quality Data Message may be applied for both
       national and international trade. It is based on universal
       commercial practice and is not dependent on the type of
       business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       - A Quality Data Message detail line may refer to either goods
       items or services.
       
       - The values within a Quality Data Message may refer to: 
       
       . a product/service, 
       . a product via batch references,
       . process type information of a product.
       
       - A Quality Data Message may contain discrete or statistical
       values as well as product specification values.

       Introduction, Section 2.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Data Segment Clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the Branching
       Diagram and the Segment Table which indicate mandatory,
       conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole
       message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and
       implementation of the message:
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format
       'yymmdd'/'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction
       agree that there is a
       functional requirement for an alternative format. Periods
       should be specified as whole numbers representing the required
       period as indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months,
       etc.) 
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not
       be included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent
       segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the
       trigger segment of a group.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as
       this inhibits automatic processing.

0480      Segment group 12: CCI-PSD-SPS-DTM-FTX-SG13-SG14-SG16-SG18
          A group of segments to be used to define a class of
          properties, the individual properties within that class and
          the related data (e.g. discrete values, statistical
          information, test methods). When this segment group is used,
          the data is directly related to the product specified.

0490         CCI, Characteristic/class id
             To specify the general class and/or the individual
             properties on which the Quality Data is being reported.
             Note: within the CCI-segment Property class, coded (7059)
             or Measurement dimension, coded (6313) or Characteristic
             identification (7037) must be present.
             
             If Property class, coded (7059) AND Measurement
             dimension, coded (6313) are present, then Characteristic
             identification (7037) is not allowed.
             
             If only Property class, coded is used within the
             CCI-segment, then the individual properties must be
             specified within the related STA/MEA-segments.
             
             The data element Characteristic (7036) should only be
             used to enhance the meaning of the code value (e.g. if no
             specific code available and code value ZZ (mutually
             defined) is used then Description can be used to further
             describe the Product Characteristics.
             
             NB: The Class identification element in this segment is
             only used to specify the product characteristic class,
             e.g. Chemistry or Physical Dimensions.

0500         PSD, Physical sample description
             A segment to define the physical sample parameters
             associated with a test resulting in discrete
             measurements. If used in this position, the values only
             apply to data within the same analysis group.

0510         SPS, Sampling parameters for summary statistics
             A segment to define the sampling parameters associated
             with summary statistics reported. If used in this
             position, the values only apply to data within the same
             analysis group.

0520         DTM, Date/time/period
             A segment specifying the date, and when relevant, the
             time of an activity identified by the date/time
             qualifier, e.g. date/time, test performed.

0530         FTX, Free text
             A segment with free text information to give further
             clarification within Segment group 12: the Analysis

                A segment specifying the date/time of the referenced
                document. The specified date should be in 'yymmdd'
                format, unless all parties agree that there is a
                functional requirement for an alternative format.


0570         Segment group 14: MEA-DTM-SG15
             A group of segments to allow measurement values or
