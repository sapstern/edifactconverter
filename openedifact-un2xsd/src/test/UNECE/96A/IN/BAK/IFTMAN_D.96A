General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Arrival
       notice message (IFTMAN) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

       This paper provides the definition of the Arrival Notice
       Message to be used in fulfilling the requirements of trading
       partners in the transport chain worldwide, in the interchange
       of cargo and transport related information using Electronic
       Data Interchange (EDI).
       
       This message is a single consignment based message, being
       aligned with other single consignment based messages such as
       the booking (IFTMBP, IFTMBF and IFTMBC) and instruction
       messages (IFTMIN and IFTMCS). The single consignment based
       messages can be used by all modes of transport for the
       forwarding and transport of goods from any origin to any
       destination, regardless of route or prevailing commercial
       practice. These messages are suitable for the arrangement of
       the transport of goods between all parties to the movement of
       the consignment (including the consignor/shipper and consignee
       as well as the forwarders, brokers, and carriers involved) as
       well as providing the information necessary to perform that
       transport and delivery of the goods. They should be used in the
       same way by each mode of transport when the requirements are
       common even if functionally similar information is known by
       different names.

1.1    Functional Definition

       A message from the party providing forwarding and/or transport
       services to the party such as has been indicated in the
       contract, giving notice and details of the arrival of the
       consignment.

1.2    Field of Application

       This message may be applied for both national and international
       trade. It is based on universal practice and is not dependent
       on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The notify party might be the consignee or his agent or the
       customs broker depending on the custom of the port or the
       conditions in the contract.
       
       - A consignment may contain several goods items.
       
       - Goods items may or may not be containerized.
       
       - A goods item may be transported in one or more containers,
       and a single container may contain one or more goods items.
       
       - One goods item may be related to one or more customs tariff
       codes.
       
       - Goods items related to one customs tariff code may be carried
       in one or more containers.
       
       - Goods items may reflect either the contractual or operational
       description of the goods.
       
       - Equipment may have other types of equipment attached to it,
       e.g. a temperature control unit attached to a container.
       
       - Equipment and/or goods items may be attached to or
       transported on another load or transport device, which as such
       may be attached to or transported on yet another load or
       transport device, e.g. a container on a chassis on a rail-car.
       
       - Transport devices, which have the ability of powered movement
       on their own, are specified in the transport details group.
       Other load or transport devices are specified as equipment.
       
       - The expression of packaging for goods items can be expressed
       at up to three levels.
       
       A number of generic transport terms are used in this
       specification, to be described as: 
       
       * MODE OF TRANSPORT: The method of transport used for the
       conveyance of goods or persons, e.g. by rail, by road, by sea.
       
       * MEANS OF TRANSPORT: The vehicle used for the transport of
       goods or persons, e.g. aircraft, truck, vessel.
       
       * TYPE OF MEANS OF TRANSPORT: The type of vehicle used in the
       transport process, e.g. wide body, tank truck, passenger
       vessel.
       
       * EQUIPMENT: Material resources necessary to facilitate the
       transport and handling of cargo. Transport equipment does under
       the given circumstances not have the ability to move by its own
       propulsion (e.g. sea container, trailer, unit load device,
       pallet).
       
       * TYPE OF EQUIPMENT: The type of material used, e.g. 40 feet
       container, four way pallet, mafi trailer.
