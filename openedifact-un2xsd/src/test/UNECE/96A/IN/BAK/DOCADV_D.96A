0.     INTRODUCTION

       credit advice message (DOCADV) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       The Documentary Credit Advice message is used to indicate to
       the Beneficiary the terms and conditions of a documentary
       credit that has been originated by the Issuing Bank and
       received by the Advising Bank (or an Intermediary Advising
       Bank).

1.2    Field of Application

       This message may be applied for both national and international
       applications for documentary credits. It is based on universal
       practice and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       Unless otherwise specified, the documentary credit is issued
       subject to the Uniform Customs and Practices for Documentary
       Credits, International Chamber of Commerce, Paris, France,
       which are in effect on the date of issue.

4.1    Data Segment Clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the Branching
       Diagram and the Segment Table which indicate mandatory,
       conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole
       message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and
       implementation of the message:
       
       - Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
       - Data that is not necessary to meet the functional
       requirements of the message should not be included.
