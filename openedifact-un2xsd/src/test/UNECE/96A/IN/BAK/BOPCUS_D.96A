General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Balance of
       payment customer transaction report message (BOPCUS) to be used
       in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners
       involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       Message sent by banks to the Balance of payment (BOP) compiler
       for reporting - one by one - individual customer transactions
       (debit and credit) processed during a specific time period.
       Actually, this transaction information can be distilled - one
       by one- from PAYORD / PAYMUL / PAYEXT and BOPINF messages
       respectively.

1.2    Field of Application

       This message is to be applied in the framework of the data
       collection for the Balance of Payment compilation.

1.3    Principles

       The content of BOPCUS is extracted from the PAYORD messages and
       the related messages (PAYMUL / PAYEXT) by the banks.
       
       Sometimes the BOPCUS message could also contain a copy of the
       relevant segments of the corresponding BOPINF - CREADV
       messages.
       
       The message contains a main loop introduced by a LIN segment
       which is used to accommodate the reporting of a large number of
       transactions without repeating identical information of the
       reporting bank.
       
       Each loop contains all the information related to one
       transaction processed via the reporting bank.
       
       Note : If the explanation below is refers to a payment order,
       please read it as a payment or a receipt.
