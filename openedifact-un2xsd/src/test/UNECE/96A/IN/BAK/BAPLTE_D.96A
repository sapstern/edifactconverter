General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the
       Bayplan/stowage plan total numbers message (BAPLTE) to be used
       in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners
       involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       A message to transmit information about the total numbers of
       equipment and quantity of goods on a means of transport. The
       message can be exchanged between (liner's) agents, tonnage
       centers, stevedores and ships masters/operators (see section
       1.3 for more details).

1.2    Field of Application

       This message may be applied for both national and international
       trade. It is based on universal practice and is not dependent
       on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       In the shipping industry the BAPLTE message can be used between
       partners as indicated below: 
       
       ships/liner ============== 1 ============== ships/liner

       PORT OF DEPARTURE(PD)            NEXT PORT OF CALL(NC)
       
       1) Agent (PD) to agent (NC) 
       2) Agent (PD) to ships master/operator (PD) 
       3) Agent (PD) to tonnage centre (PD) 
       4) Agent (PD) to stevedore (PD) 
       5) Tonnage centre (PD) to ships master/operator (PD) 
       6) Tonnage centre (PD) to tonnage centre (NC) 
       7) Tonnage centre (PD) to stevedore (PD) 
       8) Stevedore (PD) to tonnage centre 
       9) Stevedore (PD) to stevedore (NC) 
       10) Stevedore (PD) to ships master/operator (PD) 
       11) Ships master/operator to tonnage centre (NC) 
       12) Ships master/operator to stevedore (NC) 
       13) Ships master/operator to agent (NC) 
       
       The above gives only one set of communication channels per
       organisation but in practice there will be a combination of one
       or more channels per organisation from or to port of
       departure/next port of call.
       
       - The message will contain only one vessel/voyage combination,
       giving details regarding carrier, mode of transport, means of
       transport and total numbers of equipment or packages by
       location (i.e., port) and/or by type or equipment or packages.
       
       - The bayplan message BAPLIE must be used to transmit detailed
       information about equipment, location on the means of
       transport, goods descriptions and properties of equipment
       and/or goods.
