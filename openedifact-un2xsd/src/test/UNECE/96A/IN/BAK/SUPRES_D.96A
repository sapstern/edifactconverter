0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Supplier
       response message (SUPRES) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       A Reservation message is sent by a tourism operator to one or
       more service providers in order to request desired services.
       These services may be subject to confirmation by any of the
       parties concerned. The Supplier response presented herein is
       the response to the Reservation message (RESMSG).

1.2    Field of Application

       The Supplier response message may be used for both national and
       international trade. It is based on universal commercial
       practice and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       A Supplier response message may cover one or more services
       provided by one or more suppliers for a person or for a group
       of persons.
       
       This message is part of a scenario which includes research,
       availability query, reservation and cancellation of services
       relating to travel, tourism and leisure.
       
       This message is the response to the Reservation message.
