0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Financial
       cancellation message (FINCAN) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       A Financial Cancellation Message is sent by the Ordering
       Customer (or Payor or Agent on behalf of the Ordering
       Customer)or by a third party having authority on the Ordering
       Customer's payments to the Ordered Bank to request cancellation
       of a given financial message or transaction.
       
       Throughout this document: - The term 'Original Message' refers
       to the message to be cancelled (in full or part thereof); the
       term 'originator' refers to the sender of the original message.

1.2    Field of Application

       The Financial cancellation message may be used for both
       national and international trade. It is based on universal
       commercial practice and is not dependent on the type of
       business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       - This message contains one to many cancellation instructions.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Data Segment Clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the Branching
       Diagram and the Segment Table which indicate mandatory,
       conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following semantic principles applying to the message are
       intended to facilitate the understanding of the message. 
        
       The Financial Cancellation message is structured in two levels:
       A and B. 
        
       Level A Segment Groups 1, 2, 3 and 6 contains general data
       related to the whole message. 
        
       Level B Segment Groups 4 and 5 contains data identifying the
       message or transaction to be cancelled. 
        
       Where a choice of code or text is given, only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
