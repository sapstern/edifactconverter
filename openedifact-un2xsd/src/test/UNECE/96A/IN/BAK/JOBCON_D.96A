General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Job order
       confirmation message (JOBCON) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       The message intent is to confirm the receipt of information of
       a Job Order Message related to a vacancy or vacancies. The
       message is transmitted from an employment agency to an
       employer. The information is related to age, sex, profession,
       salaries, experiences, education, work and contract conditions.

1.2    Field of Application

       The Job order confirmation message may be used for both
       national and international trade. It is based on universal
       commercial practice and is not dependent on the type of
       business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The intention of the message is the confirmation by the
       employment agency of the detailed information for one or more
       jobs or vacancies offered by an employer. A Job Order
       Confirmation Message is transmitted from the employment agency
       to an employer. A Job Order Confirmation Message may contain
       detailed information about the requirements of an applicant for
       the job, e.g. age, sex, occupation or occupation type, location
       of the job, education, knowledge, experiences. A Job Order
       Confirmation Message may also contain detailed information of
       the salary offered, a job application and/or arrangements for
       an interview.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Data Segment Clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the Branching
       Diagram and the Segment Table which indicate mandatory,
       conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole
       message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and
       implementation of the message: 
       All specified dates and times should be in the format 'yymmdd'
       or 'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction agree
       that there is a functional requirement for an alternative
       format. 
       Periods should be specified as whole numbers representing the
       required period as indicated in the format qualifier (weeks,
       months, etc.) 
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible. Conditional data that is not
       required in the message should not be included. 
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent
       segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the
       trigger segment of a group.

4.1.1  Header section

       Information to be provided in the Header section:

0010 | UNH, Message header
       A service segment starting and uniquely identifying a message.
       The message type code for the Job order confirmation message is
       JOBCON.
       
       Note: Job order confirmation messages conforming to this
       document must contain the following data in segment UNH,
       composite S009:

       Data element  0065 JOBCON
                     0052 D
                     0054 96A
                     0051 UN

0020   BGM, Beginning of message
       A segment  which the sender must uniquely identify the job
       order confirmation by means of its type and number and, when
       necessary, its function, e.g. change, deletion, addition.

0030   DTM, Date/time/period
       A segment specifying general dates and, when relevant, times
       related to the whole message. The segment must be specified at
       least once to identify the document date. The Date/time/period
       segment within other Segment groups should be used whenever the

          Order Confirmation Message. It is recommended that, where
          possible, only the coded form of the party identification
          should be specified, e.g. where the enterprise and the job
          administration are known to each other, thus only the coded
          identification is required, but a job center or a job
          application address (interview) may vary and would have to
          be clearly specified, preferably in structured format.
