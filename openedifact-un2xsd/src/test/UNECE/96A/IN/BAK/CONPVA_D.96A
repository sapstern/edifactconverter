General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Payment
       valuation message (CONPVA) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       Typically this message will be used between a contractor and
       the client's representative, during the process of approving
       the value and payment for work completed for a given period of
       time.

1.2    Field of Application

       This message type may be applied for both national and
       international trade. It is based on universal practice and is
       not dependent on the type of business or industry.
       
       The following descriptions refer to the construction industry
       as an example, but do not exclude other business sectors'
       implementation.

1.3    Principles

       This message is to be used to support the business process of
       communicating the value of progress against groups of work
       items which make up a construction project.
       
       There are several examples within the construction process
       where one party is required to advise another party about the
       value of work performed during a specific time period or since
       the start of the project.
       
       A project may be subdivided into individual groupings of work,
       referred to as items and it is against these items that
       progress quantities are reported.
       
       Similar exchanges take place on the entire or part of the
       project and between other parties also involved in the
       construction of the project.
       
       Within the Construction industry there are numerous rules which
       govern this part of the process. Although, efforts have been
       made to keep the design of the message generic, other potential
       users of this message are cautioned about the specific and
       original role for which this message has been designed.
       
       This is only one of a number of messages being designed for the
       construction industry. This particular message refers to
       already established items of work, these items will have been
       defined at the start of the project. Work is well advanced for
       suitable EDI messages to address this part of the process.
       
       Allowance has been made within CONPVA message for "new" items
       of work. There are a number of reasons why additional items of
       work will occur once a project has started.
       
       Each work item may contain more than one quantity and this has
       been accommodated. An example of this would be the inclusion of
       both a cumulative and a "this period" quantity.
       
       In addition to conveying specific payment values this message
       is designed to record details of revisions and fluctuation to
       standard tables of rates and payment factors which are used in
       the calculation of the payment value.
       
       Confirmation of values processed for direct payment by the
       client are also catered for. These relate to individual entries
       within a CONDPV message.
