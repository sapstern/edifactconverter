General Introduction
----------------------------------------------------------------------



0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Vessel
       departure message (VESDEP) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       A message from a stevedore to a liner agent informing the
       latter party of the closing of a vessel's file and giving
       information on the actual container operations.
       
       This message is part of a total set of container-related
       messages. These messages serve to facilitate the intermodal
       handling of containers by streamlining the information
       exchange.
       The business scenario for the container messages is clarified
       in a separate document, called: 'Guide to the scenario of
       EDIFACT container messages'.

1.2    Field of Application

       The Vessel departure message may be used for both national and
       international trade. It is based on universal commercial
       practice and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       In the context of the 'Guide to the scenario of EDIFACT
       container messages' (as referred to at the start of section 1)
       the following guidelines, rules and functionality apply to this
       Vessel departure message:
       
       *   A message will contain information on only one means of
       transport/conveyance.
       
       *   Separate messages (Call info message and Vessel departure
       message) will be used for the means of transport in order to
       cater for opening and closing of the information exchange
       related to that means of transport. Updates for these messages
       may be sent.
       
       *   The message contents can be uniquely identified by a
       combination of the following data elements:
       - ordering customer/principal
       - ordering customer agent
       - mode of transport
       - conveyance reference number/voyage number
       
       The ordering customer agent is to supplement the unique
       identification only when several agents are acting on behalf of
       the same shipping line for the same voyage number.
