General Introduction
----------------------------------------------------------------------



0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Delivery
       schedule message (DELFOR) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

       This paper provides the definition of the United Nations
       Standard Delivery Schedule message to be used in Electronic
       Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners.

1.1    Functional Definition

       A message from buyer to supplier giving product requirements
       regarding details for short term delivery instructions and/or
       medium to long term product/service forecast for planning
       purposes according to conditions set out in a contract or
       order. The message can be used to authorize the commitment of
       labour and materials resources.

1.2    Field of Application

       The UN Standard Delivery Schedule Message may be applied for
       both national and international trade. It is based on universal
       commercial practice and is not dependent on the type of
       business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       - specify delivery schedules requested by the buyer
       
        - define the aspects that guarantee a perfect synchronization
       between buyer and seller 
       
       - provide information allowing the seller to plan for future
       requirements in order to purchase raw materials to produce and
       deliver goods in the most economical way.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Data Segment Clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the Branching
       Diagram and the Segment Table which indicate mandatory,
       conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole
       message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and
       implementation of the message:
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format
       'yymmdd'/'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction
       agree that there is a functional requirement for an alternative
       format. Periods should be specified as whole numbers
       representing the required period as indicated in the format
       qualifier (weeks, months, etc.).
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should be
       omitted.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent
       segments does not conflict with the segment qualifier of the
       trigger segment of a group.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as
       this inhibits automatic processing.

4.1.1  Header section

       Information to be provided in the Header section:

0010 | UNH, Message header
       A service segment starting and uniquely identifying a message.
       The message type code for the Delivery schedule message is
       DELFOR.
       
       Note: Delivery schedule messages conforming to this document
       must contain the following data in segment UNH, composite S009:

       Data element  0065 DELFOR
                     0052 D
                     0054 96A
                     0051 UN

0020   BGM, Beginning of message
       A segment for the unique identification of the delivery
       schedule document, by means of its name and its number.

       A segment specifying the date, and when relevant, the
       time/period of the beginning and ending of the validity period
       of the document. The DTM must be specified at least once to
       identify the Delivery Schedule document date.
       
       The date/time/period segment within other Segment group should
       be used whenever the date/time/period is logically related to
       another specified data item.


0040   Segment group 1:  RFF-DTM
       A group of segments giving references relevant to the whole
       message, e.g. contract number.

0050      RFF, Reference
          A segment for referencing documents relating to the whole
          Delivery Schedule Message, e.g. contract, import/export
          license.

          functions relevant for the whole Delivery Schedule.
          Identification of the seller and buyer parties is
          recommended for the Delivery Schedule message. Exception:
          the identification of the recipient of the goods must be
          given in the NAD segment in the detail section when
          required.
          
          It is recommended that where possible only the coded form of
          the party ID should be specified, e.g. the buyer and seller
          are known to each other, thus only the coded ID is required.
          The consignee or delivery address may vary and would have to
          be clearly specified, preferably in structured format.

0090      LOC, Place/location identification
