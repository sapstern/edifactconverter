General Introduction
----------------------------------------------------------------------



0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Remittance
       advice message (REMADV) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       The Remittance Advice is a communication between trading
       partners, e.g. seller, buyer, financial institutions, which
       provides a detailed accounting relative to a payment, or other
       form of financial settlement, for the provision of goods and/or
       services as detailed in the advice.

1.2    Field of Application

       This message may be applied for both national and international
       settlements. It is based on universal practice and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       - A Remittance Advice is a notice of a payment to be made.
       
       - A Remittance Advice may cover one or more commercial trade
       transactions (and related financial transactions), such as
       invoices, credit notes, debit notes, etc.
       
       - A Remittance Advice may include a cross reference to a
       Payment Order.
       
       - A single Remittance Advice may relate to both national and
       international settlements.
       
       - Each Remittance Advice shall be calculated in only one
       currency, even though the related transaction is denominated in
       different currencies.
       
       - Each Remittance Advice shall relate to only one settlement
       date.
       
       - Where remittance advice relates to a dispute, the message : 
       
       . does not necessarily relate to one settlement date 
       . is not necessarily a notice for a payment to be made
       
       - A Remittance Advice may be initiated by either party
       according to agreements.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Data Segment Clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the Branching
       Diagram and the Segment Table which indicate mandatory,
       conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole
       message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and
       implementation of the message: 
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format
       'yymmdd'/'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction
       agree that there is a functional requirement for an alternative
       format. Periods should be specified as whole numbers
       representing the required period as indicated in the format
       qualifier (weeks, months, etc.) 
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not
       be included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent
       segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the
       trigger segment of a group.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as
       this inhibits automatic processing.
