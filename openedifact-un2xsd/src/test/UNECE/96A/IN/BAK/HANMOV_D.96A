General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Cargo/goods
       handling and movement message (HANMOV) to be used in Electronic
       Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       A message from a party to a warehouse/distribution center
       identifying the handling services and where required the
       movement of specified goods, limited to warehouses within the
       jurisdiction of the distribution centre.

1.2    Field of Application

       The Cargo/goods handling and movement message may be used for
       both national and international trade. It is based on universal
       commercial practice and is not dependent on the type of
       business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       This message addresses the indirect flow of goods between
       seller and buyer through a warehouse/distribution center.
       
       The functions of this message are limited to: 
       
       - assembly/disassembly of goods and products, without
       interfering in the manufacturing process 
       - (re-)packing/unpacking
       - control of goods associated with the handling services but
       not interfering in the manufacturing process
       - marking and labeling on the packages of the goods but does
       not extend to the marking and labeling of the products 
       - movement of goods limited between warehouses within the
       jurisdiction of the distribution center 
       - preparation of goods for shipment
       - storage 
       - clearance
       - goods inspection
       - hazardous material handling 
       
       The movement of specified goods relates here to the area where
       control of the goods is to be exercised from the arrival of the
       goods to the distribution center until the departure of the
       goods from the distribution center to another party. It can
       include movements between warehouses within the jurisdiction of
       the distribution center. Other movements of goods will be given
       by the relevant instruction messages, i.e. IFTMIN (Instruction
       message)and Instruction For Despatch (message under
       development).
       
       The functions Assembly/Disassembly are meant to make the goods
       ready for delivery to the final customer, they are not part of
       the actual manufacturing or assembly process.
       
       - Goods items may or may not be containerized.
       - A goods item may be in one or pieces of equipment, and a
       single equipment may contain one or more goods items.
       - One goods item and/or line item may be related to one or more
       customs tariff codes.
       - Goods items may reflect either the contractual or operational
       description of the goods.
       - Equipment may have other types of equipment attached to it,
       e.g. a temperature control unit attached to a container.
       - Equipment and/or goods items may be attached to another load
       or transport device, which as such may be attached to yet
       another load or transport device, e.g. a container on a chassis
       on a railway wagon.
       - Transport devices, which have the ability of powered movement
       on their own, are specified in the transport details group.
       Other load or transport devices are specified as equipment.
       - The expression of packaging for goods items in the GID
       segment can be expressed at up to three levels.
       
       A number of generic transport terms are described in the Annex
       (glossary of terms).

Glossary of terms

A number of generic transport terms are used in this specification, to
be described as:        
* MODE OF TRANSPORT: The method of transport used for the conveyance
of goods or persons, e.g. by rail, by road, by sea.

* MEANS OF TRANSPORT: The vehicle used for the transport of goods or
persons, e.g. aircraft, truck, vessel.

* TYPE OF MEANS OF TRANSPORT: The type of vehicle used in the
transport process, e.g. wide body, tank truck, passenger vessel.

* EQUIPMENT: Material resources necessary to facilitate the transport
and handling of cargo. Transport equipment does under the given
circumstances not have the ability to move by its own propulsion (e.g.
sea container, trailer, unit load device, pallet).

* TYPE OF EQUIPMENT: The type of material used, e.g. 40 feet
container, four way pallet, mafi trailer.

Syntactical notes

The use of this message is not dependent on when the transfer of
ownership of the materials/goods takes place between the seller and
the buyer, and whether it is customs cleared or not (i.e. bonded
warehouse). It does not cover however the situation of the goods: in
this case there is no more indirect flow of goods, since the
distribution centre is acting as a seller.

A line item group is used to convey information regarding articles. A
goods item group is used to convey information regarding a number of
articles packed for shipment.

The following table indicates the possible use of the various segment
groups in the message in relation to the above functions. In one
message several of the above functions can be combined.

to goods items and/or line items must be specified in the goods and do
not overrule the handling function specified on message level.
