General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Quantity
       valuation message (CONQVA) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       Typically, this message will be used for a contractor to submit
       progress details to a client or his representative. The message
       will be used also for subsets of the project where work has
       been contracted out to other parties. In these cases the
       exchange would be between the subcontractor and the party that
       subcontracted the work.

1.2    Field of Application

       This message type may be applied for both national and
       international trade. It is based on universal practice and is
       not dependent on the type of business or industry. The
       following descriptions refer to the construction industry as an
       example, but do not exclude other business sectors'
       implementation.

1.3    Principles

       This message is to be used to support the business of
       exchanging progress information for groups of work items which
       make up a construction project.
       
       There are several examples within the construction process
       where one party is required to advise another party about the
       quantity of work performed for a specific time period or since
       the start of the project.
       
       A project may be subdivided into individual groupings of work
       referred to as items and it is against these items that
       progress quantities are reported.
       
       During the design of this message every effort has been made to
       adopt a "generic" approach and it seems possible that other
       industries may find this a suitable message to adopt.
       
       This is only one of a number of messages being designed for the
       Construction industry. This particular message refers to
       already established items of work, these items will be defined
       at the start of a project. Work is well advanced on suitable
       EDI messages to address this part of the process.
       
       Allowance has been made within the CONQVA message for "new"
       items of work. There are a number of reasons why additional
       items of work will occur once a project has started.
       
       Each work item may contain more than one quantity and this has
       been accommodated. An example of this would be the quoting of
       both a cumulative and a "this period" quantity.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Data Segment Clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the Branching
       Diagram and the Segment Table which indicate mandatory,
       conditional and repeating requirements.

4.1.1  Header section

       Information to be provided in the Header section:

0010 | UNH, Message header
       A service segment starting and uniquely identifying a message.
       The message type code for the Quantity valuation message is
       CONQVA.

       must contain the following data in segment UNH, composite S009:

       Data element  0065 CONQVA
                     0052 D
                     0054 96A
                     0051 UN

       A segment with free text information, in coded or clear form,
       used for any textual qualification. In computer to computer
       exchanges, such text will require the receiver to process this
       segment manually.

          coded form of the party ID should be specified. e.g. The
          contractor and client are known to each other, thus only the
          coded ID is required, but the subcontractors addresses may
