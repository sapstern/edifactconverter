General Introduction
----------------------------------------------------------------------



0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Job
       application result message (JAPRES) to be used in Electronic
       Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       A message specifying decisions of an employer related to job
       applications and interviews and employment or rejections and,
       when necessary, reasons for the decisions or rejections. The
       message is transmitted from an employer or employment agency to
       an employment agency.

1.2    Field of Application

       The Job application result message may be used for both
       national and international trade. It is based on universal
       commercial practice and is not dependent on the type of
       business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The intention of the message is to provide detailed information
       of results or decisions of an employer related to a job
       application or an interview. A Job Application Result Message
       may contain detailed information of the employment of an
       applicant, the rejection of an applicant by the employer or the
       rejection of the offered job by the applicant. In case of the
       rejection by the applicant, reasons of the rejection can be
       given. A Job Application Result Message is transmitted from an
       employer or employment agency to the employment agency. A Job
       Application Result Message may contain detailed information of
       more than one job applicant or interview.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Data Segment Clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the Branching
       Diagram and the Segment Table which indicate mandatory,
       conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole
       message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and
       implementation of the message:
       
       All specified dates and times should be in the format 'yymmdd'
       or 'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction agree
       that there is a functional requirement for an alternative
       format.
       
       Periods should be specified as whole numbers representing the
       required period as indicated in the format qualifier (weeks,
       months, etc.)
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not
       be included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent
       segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the
       trigger segment of a group.
