General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Container
       release order message (COREOR) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       Order to release containers, and giving permission for them to
       be picked up by or on behalf of a specified party.
       This message is part of a total set of container-related
       messages.
       These messages serve to facilitate the intermodal handling of
       containers by streamlining the information exchange.
       The business scenario for the container messages is clarified
       in a separate document, called: 'Guide to the scenario of
       EDIFACT container messages'.

1.2    Field of Application

       The Container release order message may be used for both
       national and international trade. It is based on universal
       commercial practice and is not dependent on the type of
       business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       Business area:
       Pre- and on-carriage transport of containers/equipment
       
       Sending functions include:
       Shipping agent, Logistic center, Freight forwarder, Inland
       carrier (copy)
       
       Receiving functions include:
       Container depot, Inland terminal, Container freight station,
       Freight forwarder (copy), Inland carrier (copy)
       
       In the context of the 'Guide to the scenario of EDIFACT
       container messages' (as referred to at the start of section 1)
       the following guidelines, rules and functionality apply to this
       Container release order message:
       
       *   The message contents can be uniquely identified by a
       combination of the following data elements:
       - ordering customer, coded (NAD)
       - ordering customer agent, coded (NAD)
       - container release reference number (RFF)
       The ordering customer agent, coded is needed to supplement the
       unique identification only in the next situation: the agent
       acts on behalf of several ordering customers issuing the same
       range of reference numbers for each customer.
       E.g. the ship's agent acts on behalf of several shipping lines
       issuing for each shipping line the same range of numbers.
       
       *   One shipping line, one seagoing vessel, one sea voyage
       number and one shipping agent can be specified on message top
       level.
       
       *   An indicator for the transport status (i.e., export,
       import, transhipment or continental) can be completed on
       container level (EQD-segment).
       
       *   One message may contain several containers identified by
       their prefix and number or several equipment guidelines for
       groups of (empty) containers.
       
       *   Inland transport details can be specified for each
       individual container or can be specified on message level (for
       all containers in the message); the two options must not be
       used simultaneously.
       
       *   An inland transport charges reference or a sea booking
       reference can be specified either on message level (related to
       all containers in the message) or for each individual
       container; the two options must not be used simultaneously.
       
       *   The final place of positioning can be included in case of
       routing via an inland terminal or several container freight
       stations (for stacking purposes).
       
       *   For each container up to 3 communication addresses can be
       specified to which a copy of the Container gate-in/gate-out
       report message is to be sent.
       
       *   For each container details can be specified such as
       container prefix and number, size/type, loading instructions,
       special instructions, seals, temperature, dangerous goods and
       off-dimensions details.
       
       *   A goods item may be detailed, such as number and type of
       packages, goods description,  gross weight, dangerous goods
       information and special instruction.
       
       *   Goods item information can be related to the corresponding
       containers by linking the goods item group (GID) to the
       container details group(s) (EQD) by means of the SGP-segment.
