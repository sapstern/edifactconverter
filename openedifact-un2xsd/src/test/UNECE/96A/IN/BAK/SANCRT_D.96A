0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the
       Sanitary/phytosanitary certificate message (SANCRT) to be used
       in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners
       involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

       A Sanitary/Phytosanitary Certificate permits an inspection
       authority to attest to the status (health, hygiene, freedom
       from disease or insect pests) of animal, plant or fish product,
       and provides basic details about the means of conveyance of
       that product.

1.1    Functional Definition

       A Sanitary/Phytosanitary Certificate permits an inspection
       authority to attest to the status (health, hygiene, freedom
       from disease or insect pests) of animal, plant or fish product,
       and provides basic details about the means of conveyance of
       that product.

1.2    Field of Application

       This message may be used nationally and internationally by
       government authorities and commercial entities involved in the
       process of animal, plant and fish product certification.
       Typically, the message would be used by one national authority
       to advise another that product meets exporting country
       standards and regulations. The message is intended to provide
       for all internationally agreed information requirements of
       government authorities with respect to health, phytosanitary
       and veterinary certification, including those specified by the
       Office International Des Epizooties International Zoo-Sanitary
       Code for trade in animals and animal products and by the
       International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) for trade in
       plants and plant material.

1.3    Principles

       - a single certificate is for product exported by a single
       country to a single destination country.
       
       - a certificate may cover several product items. A certificate
       should however be limited to product items of the same type or
       category.
       
       - all product covered by a certificate is transported together
       on the same transport vehicle or vehicle set at the same time.
       Transport can however occur over more than one stage.
       
       - product may be in zero, one or more containers.
       
       - inclusion of standard endorsements or generic textual
       declarations in the certificate is discouraged. It is
       recommended that these and other certification protocol
       requirements be accounted for outside the certificate in
       individual trading partner agreements.
