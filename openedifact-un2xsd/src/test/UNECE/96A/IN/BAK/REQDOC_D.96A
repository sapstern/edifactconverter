General Introduction
----------------------------------------------------------------------



0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Request for
       document message (REQDOC) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       A message to enable a party request the sending, or re-sending,
       of data, either as a document or message, or in some other
       agreed form.

1.2    Field of Application

       The Request for document message may be used for both national
       and international trade. It is based on universal commercial
       practice and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       The message is used to request a document to be sent, either
       electronically or otherwise. Its use should be limited to
       requesting documents, for which there is no other more specific
       message already provided (e.g. Request for Quotation).
       
       Parties can request documents on their own behalf, or on behalf
       of third parties.
       
       The message can be used to request individual documents by
       identity, or by specifying product and/or other related data to
       retrieve all relevant documents.
       
       Typical uses of the Request for Document Message are to request
       information from a data base (e.g. requesting a copy of a test
       certificate), requesting catalogue data, and requesting
       statements of account.

       Introduction, Section 2.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Data Segment Clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the Branching
       Diagram and the Segment Table which indicate mandatory,
       conditional and repeating requirements.

0010 | UNH, Message header
       A service segment starting and uniquely identifying a message.
       The message type code for the Request for document message is
       REQDOC.
       
       Note: Request for document messages conforming to this document
       must contain the following data in segment UNH, composite S009:

       Data element  0065 REQDOC
                     0052 D
                     0054 96A
                     0051 UN

       many copies, and in what form it is required, e.g. EDI, mail,
       etc.

0040   DTM, Date/time/period

          of the request and the recipient is mandatory for the
          request for document message. It is recommended that where
          possible only the coded form of the party ID should be
          specified e.g. the sender and receiver of the report are
          known to each other, thus only the coded ID is required, but
          when a new address might have to be clearly specified, e.g.
          where the document is to be sent to a third party, this
