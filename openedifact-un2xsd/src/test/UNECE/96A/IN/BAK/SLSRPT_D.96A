General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Sales data
       report message (SLSRPT) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       A message to enable the transmission of sales data related to
       products or services, such as corresponding location, period,
       product identification, pricing, monetary amount, quantity,
       market sector information, sales parties. It enables the
       recipient to process the information automatically and use it
       for production, planning, marketing, statistical purposes, etc.

1.2    Field of Application

       The Sales data report message may be used for both national and
       international trade. It is based on universal commercial
       practice and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       The message intent is to provide sales information for one or
       more locations for a series of products within a specified time
       period. 
       
       The message is transmitted either from a seller to its supplier
       or from a headquarters, coordination or distribution centre to
       a manufacturer, supplier or a third party, such as a marketing
       institute for statistical analysis. It allows the recipient to
       know for a specific product the: 
       
       - Location of the sale
       - Period in which it was sold
       - Product identification
       - Product selling price, quantity and value of the sales
       - Additional Identification of the products such as promotional
       flags, product group or family identification and internal
       identification numbers
       - Periodical Turnover of a specified location
       - Global specified product sales, i.e. total sales of a product
       in all locations
       - Sales channel, market segment end use
       - Sales parties identification.
       
       Though the message is location driven, it is conceivable that
       the recipient process the data to derive information based on
       other variables such as a specific product and all its related
       sales locations and/or addresses or periodic turnover and the
       related locations.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Data Segment Clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the Branching
       Diagram and the Segment Table which indicate mandatory,
       conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole
       message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and
       implementation of the message:
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format
       'yymmdd'/'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction
       agree that there is a functional requirement for an alternative
       format. Periods should be specified as whole numbers
       representing the required period as indicated in the format
       qualifier (weeks, months, etc.).
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
       Due to the high volume of data that will be usually transmitted
       in the Sales Data Report message, it is highly recommended to
       use codes for products and locations.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not
       be included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent
       segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the
       trigger segment of a group.

       Data element  0065 SLSRPT
                     0052 D
