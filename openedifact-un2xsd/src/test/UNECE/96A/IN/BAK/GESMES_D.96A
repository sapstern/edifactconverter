General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Generic
       statistical message (GESMES) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       The compilation of statistics is a continuous chain starting
       with raw data collection, followed by a number of harmonization
       and aggregation processes leading to aggregated statistical
       data.
       Raw data collection is realized by means of surveys, sampling,
       direct reporting from individuals, economic operators.
       Harmonization and aggregation processes are very often handled
       by statistical bodies or authorized economic operators in case
       of direct reporting.
       A Generic Statistical Message (GESMES) is used by an
       organisation involved in this elaboration process to transmit a
       statistical data set.
       It permits the transmission of the following, either in the
       same and/or different messages:
       -the statistical concepts comprising the data set and their
       structure
       -if required, all related information ( code sets, labels,
       methodological notes, footnotes, etc.),
       -the statistical figures of the data set.
       This message could be used by producers and users of
       statistical information such as: National Statistical Offices,
       ministries, private and public administrations, private
       companies etc.

1.2    Field of Application

       The Generic statistical message may be used for both national
       and international trade. It is based on universal commercial
       practice and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       The structure of statistical information to be exchanged is
       quite simple and could be defined as multidimensional array or
       chronological series. The difficulty of using or exchanging
       statistical data comes the varieties of interpretations of
       those structures. The interpretation varies from one
       statistical domain to another depending on the content.
       Another key factor is the volume: statistical indicators have
       many dimensions (e.g. time, classifications depending on
       statistical nomenclatures), dense and sparse series of matrices
       could be present simultaneously for the same indicator.
       The GESMES message may be used to exchange statistical data for
       all statistical domains in a variety of formats together with
       their descriptions.
       
       The data in the data set (i.e. the array) is contained in a
       generic segment (ARR - Array). The interpretation of the ARR
       segment is provided in segment group 8. GESMES is designed to
       support all types of statistical exchange, including
       time-series, which can be described by means of statistical
       concepts (i.e. statistical terms or objects).
       Associated with statistical data are textual information
       defining comprehensively the series and matrices, the
       underlying statistical concept or methodology. This is often
       referred to as meta-data and corresponds to associated
       information which is required to interpret basic data, such as
       headlines, stubs, comments and footnotes.
       
       The acronym, GESMES, stands for Generic Statistical Message and
       comprises a number of parts:
       
       i) Identification of administrative information concerning the
       interchange partners (Gr. 2)
       
       ii) Footnotes associated with value lists, statistical concepts
       and data set structures (Gr. 1)
       
       iii) Value lists of coded or non coded items to be used in this
       message or in a future message (Gr. 4)
       
       iv) Definition of statistical concepts to be used in this
       message or in a future message (Gr. 7).
       
       v) Definition of the structure of array data to be used in this
       message or in a future message, and the allocation of a unique
       identity to this definition (Gr. 8).
       
       vi) Identification of one or more data sets (Gr. 11). For each
       data set: the identity of the structure definition to be used
       to interpret the array data (Gr. 12); the scope, value lists or
       fixed values which are local to the data set (Gr. 13 and 14);
       the array data (ARR); footnotes associated with the data set
       (Gr. 18, 19 and 20).
