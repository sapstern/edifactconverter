General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Job order
       message (JOBOFF) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration,
       commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       A message specifying details for one or more vacancies
       (occupation, salaries, experiences, work and contract
       conditions) for an employer to the employment agency.

1.2    Field of Application

       The Job order message may be used for both national and
       international trade. It is based on universal commercial
       practice and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       The intention of the message is to provide detailed information
       of one or more jobs or vacancies offered by an employer to an
       employment agency or another employment agency. A Job Order
       Message is transmitted from an employer to an employment
       agency. A Job Order Message may contain detailed information
       about the requirements of an applicant for the job, e.g. age,
       sex, occupation or occupation type, location of the job,
       education, knowledge, experiences, salaries, work and contract
       conditions. A Job Order Message may also contain detailed
       information of the salary offered, a job application and/or
       arrangements for an interview.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Data Segment Clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the Branching
       Diagram and the Segment Table which indicate mandatory,
       conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole
       message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and
       implementation of the message: 
       All specified dates or times should be in the format 'yymmdd'
       or 'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction agree
       that there is a functional requirement for an alternative
       format. 
       Periods should be specified as whole numbers representing the
       required period as indicated in the format qualifier (weeks,
       months, etc.) 
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible. Conditional data that is not
       required in the message should not be included. 
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent
       segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the
       trigger segment of a group.

4.1.1  Header section

       Information to be provided in the Header section:

0010 | UNH, Message header
       A service segment starting and uniquely identifying a message.
       The message type code for the Job order message is JOBOFF.
       
       Note: Job order messages conforming to this document must

0020   BGM, Beginning of message
       A segment by which the sender must uniquely identify the job
