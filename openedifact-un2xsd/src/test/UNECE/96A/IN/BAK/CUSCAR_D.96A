General Introduction
----------------------------------------------------------------------



0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Customs cargo
       report message (CUSCAR) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       This message permits the transfer of data from a carrier to a
       Customs administration for the purpose of meeting Customs cargo
       reporting requirements.

1.2    Field of Application

       This message may be applied for both national and international
       trade. It is based on universal practice and is not independent
       on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       It is envisaged that the Customs Cargo Inventory Report Message
       may be initiated by the carrier to report single or multiple
       consignments to a Customs administration. The message is
       transmitted upon arrival of the goods, or where national
       legislation permits, prior to arrival. The data provides
       Customs with a means of "writing off" or acquitting the cargo
       report against Goods declarations. It also allows Customs to
       undertake selectivity processing in order to select high risk
       shipments requiring examination.
       
       The message may be used for reporting:
       
       (a) onward transit/transhipment;
       (b) short and part shipped goods;
       (c) empty containers;
       (d) import/export cargo;
       (e) house and masterbill relationships.
