0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Reservation
       message (RESMSG) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration,
       commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       A Reservation message is sent by a tourism operator to one or
       more service providers in order to request desired services.
       These services may be subject to confirmation by any of the
       parties concerned.

1.2    Field of Application

       The Reservation message may be used for both national and
       international trade. It is based on universal commercial
       practice and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       A Reservation message may cover one or more services provided
       by one or more suppliers for a person or for a group of
       persons.
       
       This message is part of a scenario which includes research,
       availability query, reservation and cancellation of services
       relating to travel, tourism and leisure.
       
       The response to this message is the Supplier response message
       (SUPRES).
