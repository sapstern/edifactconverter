General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Container
       pre-notification message (COPINO) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       A message by which an inland carrier notifies of the delivery
       or pick-up of containers.
       
       This message is part of a total set of container-related
       messages. These messages serve to facilitate the intermodal
       handling of containers by streamlining the information
       exchange.
       The business scenario for the container messages is clarified
       in a separate document, called: 'Guide to the scenario of
       EDIFACT container messages'.

1.2    Field of Application

       The Container pre-notification message may be used for both
       national and international trade. It is based on universal
       commercial practice and is not dependent on the type of
       business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       Business area:
       Pre- and on-carriage transport of containers/equipment
       
       Sending functions include:
       Inland carrier
       
       Receiving functions include:
       Container depot, Inland terminal, Container freight station,
       Container terminal, Carrier's agent, Forwarder, Shipper,
       Consignee
       
       In the context of the 'Guide to the scenario of EDIFACT
       container messages' (as referred to at the start of section 1)
       the following guidelines, rules and functionality apply to this
       Container pre-notification message:
       
       *   The message contents can be uniquely identified by a
       combination of the following message top level data elements:
       -   operating inland carrier, coded (TDT)
       -   mode of transport (TDT)
       -   inland voyage number/indication (TDT)
       
       *   The container announcement reference, in combination with:
       - the Ordering customer, coded and
       - the Agent of the ordering customer, coded
       can be used to refer to information in the Container
       announcement message.
       
       *   An extraction of this message can be sent to the Ordering
       customer (agent) of the Container announcement, e.g. Shipping
       agent, Logistic center and Freight forwarder, for their
       information. The Container pre-notification will be split up in
       as many messages as there are different Ordering customers
       (agent) of the Container announcement message.
       
       *   A message is to be set up for each road conveyance, track
       (rail) or call (inland waterways) of a means of inland
       transport.
       
       The expected arrival date and time can be given once (on
       message top level) for the means of transport as a whole.
       
       *   One message may contain several containers.
       
       *   For each container its size and type can be specified,
       including prefix and number if known.
       
       *   If the container prefix and number is unknown, a
       supplementary container reference (Container sequence number)
       is used to identify a container (group) in the message.
       
       *   An indicator for the transport status (i.e. export, import,
       transhipment or continental) is to be completed on container
       level (EQD-segment).
       
       *   Main carriage transport details, such as shipping line, can
       be specified for each individual container.
       
       *   The final place of positioning can be included in case of
       routing via an inland terminal or several container freight
       stations (for stacking purposes).
       
       *   For each individual container dangerous goods details can
       be specified.
