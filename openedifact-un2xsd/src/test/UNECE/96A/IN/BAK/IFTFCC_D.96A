General Introduction
----------------------------------------------------------------------



0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the International
       transport freight costs and other charges message (IFTFCC) to
       be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading
       partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       A message specifying freight, handling and transport costs and
       other related charges between transport service providers and
       their customers.

1.2    Field of Application

       The International transport freight costs and other charges
       message may be used for both national and international trade.
       It is based on universal commercial practice and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The message will enable the parties involved in transport
       operations to indicate the various charges and costs. The
       structure of this information will enable parties to relate the
       charges and freight costs information received to the original
       instruction given by other transport messages (e.g. IFTMCS) to
       allow a one-by-one verification of the statement of charges. 
       
       - The message is based on the applicable version of the UN/ECE
       Recommendation No. 23: Freight Cost Code - FCC, Harmonization
       of the description of freight costs and other charges. 
       
       - Freight costs and or other charges may be related to: a
       single consignment, a number of consignments and or a number of
       equipment (periodical or consolidated charging), goods items
       and or a voyage conveyance flight of a means of transport. 
       
       - Negative totals can be specified when credit notes and
       refunds form part of the charge handling. 
       
       - Four main segment groups on message level follow after the
       PAT segment group, respectively:
       1) TDT segment group (segment group 17): transport details
       2) GID segment group (segment group 19): goods item details
       3) EQD segment group (segment group 24): equipment details
       4) CNI segment group (segment group 28): consignment details
       Each segment group may specify details to which the given
       charges relate. 
       
       - Full details for a charge are specified in the TCC segment
       group on message top level. Single TCC segments occur on the
       lower levels of the message. These single TCC segments can be
       used, wherever appropriate, as pointers to full charge details
       which are given in the TCC segment group on message top level.
       When the TCC segment is used as a pointer then only the data
       element 'Freight and charges item number' (in composite C200)
       is to be used. 
       
       - The annex includes a number of stylized examples, showing the
       basic outlines of how the message can be applied. 
       
       - A consignment may contain several goods items. 
       
       - Goods items may or may not be containerized. 
       
       - A goods item may be transported in one or more containers,
       and a single container may contain one or more goods items. 
       
       - Pre-carriage (advanced haulage) and or on-carriage
       (destination haulage) of goods items or equipment within one
       booking or instruction may take place in different steps, when
       each step is specified with its own transport details group. 
       
       - Equipment may have other types of equipment attached to it. 
       
       A number of generic transport terms are used in this
       specification, to be described as: 
       
       * Mode of transport: the method of transport used for the
       conveyance of goods or persons. 
       
       * Means of transport: the vehicle used for the transport of
       goods or persons. 
       
       * Type of means of transport: the type of vehicle used in the
       transport process. 
       
       * Equipment: material resources necessary to facilitate the
       transport and handling of cargo. Transport equipment does under
       the given circumstances not have the ability to move by its own
       propulsion. 
       
       * Type of equipment: the type of equipment used.

          applying to this charge. If a percentage forms a factor in a
          calculation the PCD segment within the MOA segment group

          group.

                amount can be re-calculated, such as:
                -   from charge currency (i.e. currency in which the
                charge applies) into reference currency (i.e. currency
                in which freight is payable)
                -   from reference currency into invoice currency
