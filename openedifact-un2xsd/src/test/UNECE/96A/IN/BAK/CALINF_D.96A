General Introduction
----------------------------------------------------------------------



0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Call info
       message (CALINF) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration,
       commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       A message from a liner agent to a stevedore providing
       information concerning the planned arrival of a vessel and the
       expected container operations.
       
       This message is part of a total set of container-related
       messages. These messages serve to facilitate the intermodal
       handling of containers by streamlining the information
       exchange.
       The business scenario for the container messages is clarified
       in a separate document, called: 'Guide to the scenario of
       EDIFACT container messages'.

1.2    Field of Application

       The Call info message may be used for both national and
       international trade. It is based on universal commercial
       practice and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       In the context of the 'Guide to the scenario of EDIFACT
       container messages' (as referred to at the start of section 1)
       the following guidelines, rules and functionality apply to this
       Call info message:
       
       *   A message will contain information on only one means of
       transport/conveyance.
       
       *   Separate messages (Call info message and Vessel departure
       message) will be used for the means of transport in order to
       cater for opening and closing of the information exchange
       related to that means of transport.
       Updates for these messages may be sent.
       
       *   Arrival of equipment is the movement of equipment towards
       the premises of a stevedore, inland (equipment) depot,
       container freight station - independent of the mode of
       transport.
