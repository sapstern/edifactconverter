       that its account has been or will be debited for a specified
       amount on the date indicated, in settlement of the referenced
       business transaction(s).

1.2    Field of Application

       This message may be applied for both national and international
       settlements. It is based on universal practice and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

       securities trading.
