0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Extended
       payment order message (PAYEXT) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       An Extended Payment Order is sent by the Ordering Customer (or
       Payor or Agent on behalf of the Ordering Customer) to the
       Ordered Bank, to instruct the Ordered Bank to debit an account
       it services for the Ordering Customer, and to arrange for the
       payment of a specified amount to the Beneficiary (or Payee or
       Agent in favour of Beneficiary) in settlement of the referenced
       business transaction(s), and to provide to the Payee full
       details of the transactions to which the Extended Payment Order
       relates.
       
       Throughout this document, the term 'Ordering Customer' refers
       to either an Ordering Customer, or a Payor or Agent acting on
       behalf of the Ordering Customer; likewise the term
       'Beneficiary' refers to either a Beneficiary, or a Payee or
       Agent acting on behalf of the Beneficiary.

1.2    Field of Application

       This message may be applied for both national and international
       settlements. It is based on universal practice and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       An Extended Payment Order may cover the financial settlement of
       one or more commercial trade transactions, such as invoices,
       credit notes, debit notes, etc. It is not intended for use in
       securities trading.
       
       The Ordered Bank may need a confirmation/ authorization to be
       able to process the Extended Payment Order Message.
