0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Invoice
       message (INVOIC) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration,
       commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       A message claiming payment for goods or services supplied under
       conditions agreed between the seller and the buyer.
       
       The United Nations Standard Invoice Message, with correct data
       qualification, serves also as the specification for Debit Note
       and Credit Note messages. Throughout this document, the
       reference to 'Invoice' may be interpreted as conveying the
       wider meaning of 'Invoice/Credit Note/Debit Note'.

1.2    Field of Application

       The UN Standard Invoice Message may be applied for both
       national and international trade. It is based on universal
       commercial practice and is not dependent on the type of
       business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       - A seller may invoice for one or more transactions
       
       - An invoice may refer to goods, items or services related to
       one or more orders, delivery instructions, call-offs, etc.
       
       - An invoice may contain references to payment terms 
       
       - An invoice for cross border transactions may contain
       additional information for customs and/or statistical
       purposes/services
       
       - An invoice may contain transport details.

       Introduction, Section 2.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Data Segment Clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the Branching
       Diagram and the Segment Table which indicate mandatory,
       conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole
       message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and
       implementation of the message: 
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format
       'yymmdd'/'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction
       agree that there is a functional requirement for an alternative
       format. Periods should be specified as whole numbers
       representing the required period as indicated in the format
       qualifier (weeks, months, etc.) 
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not
       be included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent
       segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the
       trigger segment of a group.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as
       this inhibits automatic processing.

4.1.1  Header section

       Information to be provided in the Header section:

0010 | UNH, Message header
       A service segment starting and uniquely identifying a message.
       The message type code for the Invoice message is INVOIC.
       
       Note: Invoice messages conforming to this document must contain
       the following data in segment UNH, composite S009:

       Data element  0065 INVOIC
                     0052 D
                     0054 96A
                     0051 UN

0020   BGM, Beginning of message
       A segment by which the sender must uniquely identify the
       invoice by means of its type and number and when necessary its
       function.

0030   DTM, Date/time/period
       A segment specifying general dates and, when relevant, times
       related to the whole message. The segment must be specified at
       least once to identify the invoice date. Examples of the use of
       this DTM segment is: "shipped on date" or "delivery date".
       
       The Date/time/period segment within other Segment groups should
       be used whenever the date/time/period requires to be logically
       related to another specified data item e.g. Payment due date is
       specified within the PAT Segment group.

0040   PAI, Payment instructions
       A segment requesting or confirming conditions of payment,
       guarantee and method of payment for the whole invoice. An
       example of the use of this segment is to specify the type of
       documentary credit used in the transaction.

          where possible only the coded form of the party ID should be
          specified e.g. The Buyer and Seller are known to each other,
          thus only the coded ID is required, but the Consignee or
          Delivery address may vary and would have to be clearly
          specified, preferably in structured format.

0130      LOC, Place/location identification
