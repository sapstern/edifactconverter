0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Purchase
       order response message (ORDRSP) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       A message from the seller to the buyer, responding to a
       purchase order message or a purchase order change request
       message.

1.2    Field of Application

       The UN Standard Purchase Order Response Message may be applied
       for both national and international trade. It is based on
       universal commercial practice and is not dependent on the type
       of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       - A seller may respond for one or more goods items or services.
       
       - The response may be for a Purchase order or a Purchase order
       change request: 
       
       - an acknowledgment of receipt and understanding of data, 
       
       - confirmation of acceptance, 
       
       - a proposal of amendment, 
       
       - a notification of non-acceptance for all or part of the
       message.
       
       - A purchase order response may refer to goods items or
       services related to one or more delivery schedules, call-offs,
       etc.
       
       - A purchase order response for cross-border transactions may
       contain additional information for customs and/or statistical
       purposes.
       
       - A purchase order response may contain details for transport
       and destination as well as delivery patterns.
       
       - A buyer's purchase order may be responded to by one or more
       response messages, according to business practice.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Data Segment Clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the Branching
       Diagram and the Segment Table which indicate mandatory,
       conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       For guidance, the following principles serve to remove
       ambiguity in the application of an EDI Purchase Order Response
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format
       'yymmdd'/'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction
       agree that there is a functional requirement for an alternative
       format. Periods should be specified as whole numbers
       representing the required period as indicated in the format
       qualifier (weeks, months, etc.) 
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not
       be included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent
       segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the
       trigger segment of a group.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as
       this inhibits automatic processing.

4.1.1  Header section

       Information to be provided in the Header section:

0010 | UNH, Message header
       A service segment starting and uniquely identifying a message.
       The message type code for the Purchase order response message
       is ORDRSP.
       
       Note: Purchase order response messages conforming to this
       document must contain the following data in segment UNH,
       composite S009:

       Data element  0065 ORDRSP
                     0052 D
                     0054 96A
                     0051 UN

0020 | BGM, Beginning of message
       A segment by which the sender must uniquely identify the order
       response by means of its number and when necessary its
       function.

0030   DTM, Date/time/period
       A segment specifying general dates and, when relevant, times
       related to the whole message. The segment must be specified at
       least once to identify the order response date.
       
       Examples of the use of this DTM segment are: Lead times that
       apply to the whole of the Order response and, if no schedule is
       to be specified, the delivery date.
       
       The Date/time/period segment within other Segment groups should
       be used whenever the date/time/period needs to be logically
       related to another specified data item. e.g. Payment due date
       is specified within the PAT Segment group.

0040   PAI, Payment instructions
       A segment requesting or confirming conditions of payment,
       guarantee and method of payment for the whole order response An
       example of the use of this segment is to specify that a
       documentary credit will be used.

0050   ALI, Additional information
       A segment indicating special conditions related to the total
       order response owing to origin, customs preference, or other
       commercial factors.

0060   IMD, Item description
       A segment providing a description common to all line items of
       the order response.

0070   FTX, Free text
       A segment with free text information, in coded or clear form,
       used when additional information is needed but cannot be
       accommodated within other segments. In computer to computer
       exchanges such text will normally require the receiver to
       process this segment manually.


0080   Segment group 1:  RFF-DTM
       A group of segments for giving references and where necessary,
       their dates, relating to the whole message, e.g. contract
       number, import/export licence number, reservation number.

          coded or clear form, and their functions relevant to the
          order response. Identification of the seller and buyer
          parties is mandatory for the order response message. It is
          recommended that where possible only the coded form of the
          party ID should be specified. e.g. The Buyer and Seller are
          known to each other, thus only the coded ID is required, but
          the Consignee or Delivery address may vary and would have to
          be clearly specified, preferably in structured format.

Semantic Notes 

These notes are not exhaustive, they are there only for clarification.

The following Semantic Notes concern the use of the BGM Segment:

- If the MESSAGE FUNCTION CODE is a "12", "27" or "29" indicating that
the total message was not processed, rejected or accepted. No
segments, other than mandatory segments, need be used in the message
Header, Detail or Summary sections. However for positive reporting
purposes all the segments of the ORDERS or ORDCHG message, being
responded to, may be used in ORDRSP.

- If the MESSAGE FUNCTION CODE is a "28" indicating an accepted ORDERS
or ORDCHG message with amended heading information or "34" indicating
amendment in the message, then all segments in the heading section
must be used from the ORDRES or ORDCHG message being responded to.
This includes both amended and non amended segments.

If the ORDERS message was "NOT PROCESSED"; use of MESSAGE FUNCTION
CODE "12" indicates acknowledgement that the transmitted message has
been received and understood by the seller, but remains to be
processed within his application system.

If the Order or Order Change message was "NOT ACCEPTED"; use of
MESSAGE FUNCTION CODE "27" indicates that the seller declines to
supply the goods or declines to accept the changes requested in a
Purchase Order Change Request.

If the ORDER or ORDER CHANGE message was "ACCEPTED, WITH AMENDMENT IN
HEADING SECTION"; use of MESSAGE FUNCTION CODE "28" indicates that the
seller accepts to supply the goods or services requested in the
Purchase Order (or a Purchase Order Change Request), but requires one
or more changes to the terms set out in the referenced message Heading
Section.
The complete Heading Section data is transmitted to replace all data
previously sent. The Detail Section is considered as acknowledged
without change.

If the ORDER or ORDER CHANGE message was "ACCEPTED, WITHOUT
AMENDMENT"; use of MESSAGE FUNCTION CODE "29" indicates that the
seller according to the terms set out in the Purchase Order or a
Purchase Order Change Request accepts to supply the goods or services
requested or where appropriate accepts the cancellation.

If the ORDER or ORDER CHANGE message was "ACCEPTED, WITH AMENDMENT IN
DETAIL SECTION"; use of MESSAGE FUNCTION CODE "30" indicates that the
seller accepts to supply the goods or services requested in the
Purchase Order (or a Purchase Order Change Request), but requires
changes in one or more line items (as indicated in the LIN segments).
The Heading Section is considered as acknowledged without change If
the ORDER or ORDER CHANGE message was "ACCEPTED WITH AMENDMENT"; use
of MESSAGE FUNCTION CODE "34" indicates that the seller accepts to
supply the goods or services requested in the Purchase Order and
Purchase Order Change Request, but requires changes in the Heading as
well as Detail Section.

The following Semantic Note concern the use of the LIN segment and D/E
1229 Action Request Code for segment group 25.

If the MESSAGE FUNCTION CODE is "30" indicating that there is amended
detail data or "34" indicating amendments in the message, only the
"amended" or "referenced" LIN segments, and all their subordinate
segments, need to be included in the detail section.

If the MESSAGE FUNCTION CODE is other than "30" or "34" there are no
amendments to the detail section and the entire section is not
required in the message. However for positive acknowledgement
purposes, users may wish to resend the entire detail section of the
ORDERS or ORDCHG message.

The value of the ACTION REQUEST CODE in the included LIN segment will
indicate the extent of amendment or reference use.

If the line item has not yet been processed and is not being formally
acknowledged an ACTION REQUEST CODE "4" indicates "NO ACTION".

If the seller accepts to supply the line item an ACTION REQUEST CODE
(D/E 1229) "5" indicates "ACCEPTED WITHOUT AMENDMENT".

If the seller accepts to supply the line item, but requires one or
more amendments to the terms set out in the referenced message, as
indicated by the data following the LIN segment. An ACTION REQUEST
CODE "6" indicates "ACCEPTED WITH AMENDMENT".

If the seller declines to supply the line items in a Purchase Order,
or in a Purchase Order Change Request an ACTION REQUEST CODE "7"
indicates "NOT ACCEPTED".

If the seller indicates that a request for change on this line item
cannot be processed as the referenced item cannot be located in his
application system an ACTION REQUEST CODE "10" indicates "NOT FOUND".

If the line item has not changed in status and no action has been
taken, and the item is transmitted for information purposes or
positioning an ACTION REQUEST CODE "11" indicates "NOT AMENDED".
