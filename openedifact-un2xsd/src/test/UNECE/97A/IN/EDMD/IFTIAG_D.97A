0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Dangerous
       cargo list message (IFTIAG) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       The International Forwarding and Transport Dangerous Cargo List
       Message is a message: 
       
       - from the party acting on behalf of the carrier for the
       gathering of the dangerous goods information of the cargo in a
       certain port or place of call or loading, 
       - to the party acting on behalf of the carrier in the next port
       or place of call or discharge, 
       
       conveying the information relating to one conveyance or voyage
       of a means of transport such as a vessel, train, truck or
       barge, on the dangerous goods being carried on board -
       irrespective of the operations that will take place in the next
       port of call. 
       This message provides the basic information by which the
       message recipient can notify to the local authorities about the
       loading, unloading and transit-related operations, by means of
       the International forwarding and transport dangerous goods
       notification message (IFTDGN).

1.2    Field of Application

       The Dangerous cargo list message may be used for both national
       and international applications. It is based on universal
       practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and
       is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The Dangerous Cargo List corresponds to IMO FAL Form 7 (in
       preparation), which always has to be on board of the vessel. 
        
       An agent in the following port of call uses the Dangerous Cargo
       List to draw up the IFTDGN message (Dangerous Goods
       Notification) to the responsible authorities in order to report
       the goods discharged, loaded or in transit. 
        
       A shipping agent in a port of loading sends the Dangerous Cargo
       List message to all the agents of the same shipping line in the
       subsequent ports of call. 
       In turn, a shipping agent in the following port of call makes
       up an additional Dangerous Cargo List for the dangerous goods
       loaded in that port, to be communicated to the agents in the
       ports called thereafter. 
        
       More than one Dangerous Cargo List can exist for one vessel in
       case of a consortium. 
        
       Sometimes the Dangerous Cargo list is sent from agent to agent
       via the carrier (shipowner). 
        
       The following guidelines, rules and functionality apply to the
       message: 
        
       *   One message relates to one conveyance/voyage of a means of
       transport. 
        
       *   One message is to be suitable to give information on
       dangerous goods on board. 
        
       *   One message is to be based on the local legal information
       requirements regarding the notification of dangerous goods to
       the (port) authority. 
        
       *   One message may contain several consignments. 
        
       *   A consignment may contain several goods items/dangerous
       goods classes. 
        
       *   Each goods item can contain only one dangerous goods class.
       A goods item reflects the operational description of the goods.
       
        
       *   A dangerous goods class may be transported in one or more
       equipment, and a single equipment may contain one or more
       dangerous goods classes. 
        
       *   The message has to cater for the provision of sending
       updates (change, deletion or cancellation).
