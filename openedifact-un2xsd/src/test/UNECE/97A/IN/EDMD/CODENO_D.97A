General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Permit
       expiration/clearance ready notice message (CODENO) to be used
       in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners
       involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       Notice specifying the cargo for which either the validity of
       the permits/Customs documents expires at short notice or for
       which regulatory Customs clearance has taken place.
       
       This message is part of a total set of container-related
       messages. These messages serve to facilitate the intermodal
       handling of containers by streamlining the information
       exchange.
       The business scenario for the container messages is clarified
       in a separate document, called: 'Guide to the scenario of
       EDIFACT container messages'.

1.2    Field of Application

       The Permit expiration/clearance ready notice message may be
       used for both national and international applications. It is
       based on universal practice related to administration, commerce
       and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       Business area: 
       Pre- and on-carriage transport of containers/equipment 
        
       Sending functions include: 
       Container terminal, Inland terminal, Freight forwarder
       (including Non-Vessel Operating Common Carrier (NVOCC)) 
        
       Receiving functions include: 
       Shipping agent, Logistic Center, Freight forwarder 
        
       In the context of the 'Guide to the scenario of EDIFACT
       container messages' (as referred to at the start of section 1)
       the following guidelines, rules and functionality apply to this
       Permit expiration/clearance ready notice message:
        
       *   In the case where the CODENO message is used as a Permit
       expiration notice the message contents can be uniquely
       identified by a combination of the following data elements:
       - ordering customer, coded (NAD) 
       - ordering customer agent, coded (NAD) 
       - container announcement reference number (being the acceptance
       order reference number) (RFF) 
       In case the CODENO is used as a Customs clearance ready notice
       the message contents can be uniquely identified by a
       combination of the following message level data elements:
       - carrier agent, coded (shipping agent) (NAD)
       - carrier, coded (shipping line) (TDT)
       - carrier's agent reference number (RFF)
        
       *   In one message customs documents for several containers can
       be included.
        
       *   One shipping line, one seagoing vessel, one sea voyage
       number and one shipping agent can be specified on message top
       level.
        
       *   The document type, number, its date of issue and expiration
       can be given for each goods item which can be related to the
       corresponding containers by linking the goods item group (GID)
       to the container details group(s) (EQD) by means of the SGP
       segment.
        
       *   For logistic purposes the pick-up address of Customs
       documents can be specified.
