4.1    Data Segment Clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the Segment
       Table which indicate mandatory, conditional and repeating

       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole

       - Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
       
       - Data that is not necessary to meet the functional
       requirements of the message should not be included.
