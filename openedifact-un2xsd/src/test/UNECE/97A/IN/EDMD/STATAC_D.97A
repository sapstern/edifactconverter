0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Statement of
       account message (STATAC) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       A Statement of Account is a communication from a Seller or his
       agent to a Buyer or his agent, providing information about the
       status of an account at a specific point in time. It is used as
       an aid to reconciliation. At the same time it may be a reminder
       of payment due.

1.2    Field of Application

       The UN Standard Statement of Account Message may be used for
       both national and international business. It is based on
       universal commercial practice and is not dependent on the type
       of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       - A Statement of Account may refer to only one account, in one
       currency.
       
       - A statement of Account contains only outstanding debts and
       does not specify any debts which have been cleared since the
       previous Statement.
       
       - A Statement of Account may be initiated at any time by the
       Seller, depending upon agreement between the Buyer and the
       Seller.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Data Segment Clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the Segment
       Table which indicate mandatory, conditional and repeating
       requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole
       message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and
       implementation of the message:
       
        All specified dates/times should be in the format
       'yymmdd'/'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction
       agree that there is a functional requirement for an alternative
       format. Periods should be specified as whole numbers
       representing the required period as indicated in the format
       qualifier (weeks, months, etc.) 
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not
       be included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent
       segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the
       trigger segment of a group.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as
       this inhibits automatic processing. It is only used when
       additional information that cannot be accommodated within the
       other segments is required.
