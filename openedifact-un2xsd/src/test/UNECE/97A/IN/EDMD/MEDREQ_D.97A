0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Medical
       service request message (MEDREQ) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       A Medical Service Request message is sent from a service
       requester to the service provider to order investigations, to
       modify a previous order or ordered investigation or to cancel a
       previous order.

1.2    Field of Application

       The Medical service request message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       The message fulfills the requirements of the European
       pre-standard concerning messages for exchange of laboratory
       information within clinical chemistry, clinical biochemistry,
       toxicology, clinical immunology, immunohaematology, haematology
       and clinical microbiology. The message may, however, also be
       used for other purposes as long as the user requirements are
       meet.
       
       The CEN prENV New Laboratory Service Order message and the CEN
       prENV Laboratory Service Order Cancellation message may be
       considered as special cases of the CEN prENV Laboratory Service
       Order Modification message. The Laboratory Service Order
       Modification message may contain a mixture of new, change,
       cancel and other service types for the order itself and for the
       various requested investigations whereas the New Laboratory
       Service Order message only contains the new service type for
       the order itself and the various requested investigations and
       the Laboratory Service Order Cancellation message only contains
       the cancel service type for a complete order.
       
       The overall structure of the message is:
       - One message may include one or more service orders. 
       - The service order is connected to one service provider, one
       service requester and optionally one or more parties to receive
       copies of the order and/or subsequent result message(s).
       - Every service order is related to one main subject of
       investigation (patient, animal or material), but may also
       include information about several related subjects of
       investigation.
       - Every service order may request services concerning one or
       more samples (from the same subject of investigation) or the
       subject of investigation itself.
       - Every sample may have one collection site.
       - A requested investigation may be connected to one or more
       samples or to the subject of investigation itself.
       
       With the exception of information in FTX segments, all
       information should primarily be expressed as codes.
