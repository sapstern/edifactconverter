0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Invoice
       message (INVOIC) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration,
       commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       A message claiming payment for goods or services supplied under
       conditions agreed between the seller and the buyer.
       
       The United Nations Standard Invoice Message, with correct data
       qualification, serves also as the specification for Debit Note
       and Credit Note messages. Throughout this document, the
       reference to 'Invoice' may be interpreted as conveying the
       wider meaning of 'Invoice/Credit Note/Debit Note'.

1.2    Field of Application

       The UN Standard Invoice Message may be applied for both
       national and international trade. It is based on universal
       commercial practice and is not dependent on the type of
       business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       - A seller may invoice for one or more transactions
       
       - An invoice may refer to goods, items or services related to
       one or more orders, delivery instructions, call-offs, etc.
       
       - An invoice may contain references to payment terms 
       
       - An invoice for cross border transactions may contain
       additional information for customs and/or statistical
       purposes/services
       
       - An invoice may contain transport details.

       Introduction, Section 2.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Data Segment Clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the Segment
       Table which indicate mandatory, conditional and repeating
       requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole
       message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and
       implementation of the message: 
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format
       'yymmdd'/'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction
       agree that there is a functional requirement for an alternative
       format. Periods should be specified as whole numbers
       representing the required period as indicated in the format
       qualifier (weeks, months, etc.) 
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not
       be included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent
       segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the
       trigger segment of a group.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as
       this inhibits automatic processing.

4.1.1  Header section
