General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Container
       announcement message (COPARN) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       The message contains an order to release, to make available, to
       accept or to call down containers or to announce the impending
       arrival of containers.
       
       This message is part of a total set of container-related
       messages. These messages serve to facilitate the intermodal
       handling of containers by streamlining the information
       exchange.
       The business scenario for the container messages is clarified
       in a separate document, called: 'Guide to the scenario of
       EDIFACT container messages'.
       
       The order may pertain to cargo related containers (full
       container load and less than container load), the arrangement
       of empty containers prior to loading and after stripping, as
       well as the arrangements for leasing the empty containers
       (on-hire and off-hire of containers).

1.2    Field of Application

       The Container announcement message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       Business area:
       Pre- and on-carriage transport of containers/equipment
       
       Sending functions include:
       Shipper, Freight forwarder, Shipping agent, Container freight
       station, Consignee
       
       Receiving functions include:
       Freight forwarder, Shipping agent, Container terminal, Inland
       terminal, Container depot, Container freight station, Container
       lessor
       
       In the context of the 'Guide to the scenario of EDIFACT
       container messages' (as referred to at the start of section 1)
       the following guidelines, rules and functionality apply to this
       Container announcement message:
       
       *   The message contents can normally be uniquely identified by
       a combination of the following data elements:
       - ordering customer, coded (NAD)
       - ordering customer agent, coded (NAD)
       - container announcement reference number (being the container
       release order reference, acceptance order reference,
       disposition order reference) (RFF)
       - related container announcement reference (reference to
       container disposition order) (RFF)
       
       In case the COPARN is used as an empty container notice the
       identification is normally achieved by:
       - carrier agent, coded (shipping agent) (EQD/NAD)
       - carrier, coded (shipping line) (TDT)
       - carrier agent's reference number (EQD/RFF)
       
       In case the COPARN is used as an on-hire request or order the
       identification is normally achieved by:
       - message sender (NAD)
       - lessee's reference (RFF)
       - indication on-hire request or order (BGM)
       
       In case the Container announcement message is used as an
       off-hire request or notice the identification is normally
       achieved by:
       - message sender (NAD)
       - return reference (RFF)
       - indication off-hire request or notice (BGM)
       
       The ordering customer agent, coded is needed to supplement the
       unique identification only in the next situation: the agent
       acts on behalf of several ordering customers issuing the same
       range of reference numbers for each customer.
       E.g. the ship's agent acts on behalf of several shipping lines
       issuing for each shipping line the same range of numbers.
       
       *   One shipping line, one seagoing vessel, one sea voyage
       number and one shipping agent can be specified on message top
       level.
       
       *   An indicator for the transport status (i.e., export,
       import, transhipment or continental) can be completed on
       container level (EQD-segment).
       
       *   One message may contain several containers identified by
       their prefix and number or several equipment guidelines for
       groups of (empty) containers.
       
       *   If the container prefix and number is unknown (in the Empty
       container disposition order or Container release order), a
       supplementary container reference number (Container sequence
       number) is used to identify a container group in the message to
       be able to refer to this information of the container(s) in
       e.g. the Container release order or the Container
       gate-in/gate-out message.
       
       *   In case of an Empty container disposition order several
       equipment guidelines can be specified in the message in order
       to load (empty) containers that cannot be identified by their
       full prefix and serial numbers.
       In case of a guideline a combination of size and type and/or a
       certain range of equipment serial numbers (container prefix and
       numbers) can be given for a group of one or several containers.
       
       *   Inland transport details can be specified for each
       individual container or can be specified on message level (for
       all containers in the message); the two options must not be
       used simultaneously.
       
       *   An inland transport charges reference or a sea booking
       reference can be specified either on message level (related to
       all containers in the message) or for each individual
       container; the two options must not be used simultaneously.
       
       *   In case of an Empty container disposition order or a Call
       down order the place of positioning, related reference and
       date/time of positioning of the containers can be specified
       either on message level (related to all goods items in the
       message) or for each individual goods item (as the place where
       the goods item is to be stuffed or stripped); the two options
       must not be used simultaneously.
       In the latter case up to 10 places of positioning for each
       goods item to be stripped from or stuffed in the container(s)
       can be included in the message.
       
       *   In case of an Acceptance order the date and time of
       positioning of the containers at the place of positioning can
       be specified for each individual container.
       
       *   The final place of positioning can be included in case of
       routing via an inland terminal or several container freight
       stations (for stacking purposes).
       
       *   For each container up to 3 communication addresses can be
       specified to which a copy of the Container gate-in/gate-out
       report message is to be sent.
       
       *   For each container details can be specified such as
       container prefix and number, size/type, loading instructions,
       special instructions, seals, temperature, dangerous goods and
       off-dimensions details.
       
       *   In case of export the port of discharge and a port of
       transhipment can be specified for each individual container.
       
       *   A goods item may be detailed, such as number and type of
       packages, goods description,  gross weight, dangerous goods
       information and special instruction.
       
       *   Goods item information can be related to the corresponding
       containers by linking the goods item group (GID) to the
       container details group(s) (EQD) by means of the SGP-segment.
       
       *   In case of export for each goods item up to 9 declarant's
       reference numbers can be given; in case of goods declaration
       (Customs) at the place of stuffing also 9 accompanying
       (Customs) documents can be given.
       
       * The return address (in case of an off-hire notice) can be
       given on message level or on container level, but not
       simultaneously. The region for the empty equipment return (in
       the request) can be given on message level. The reference at
       the return address or region of return can be given at the same
       level.
