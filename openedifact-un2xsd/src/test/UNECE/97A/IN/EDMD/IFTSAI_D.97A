       of operation and type of transport desired may be precised to
       limit the volume of information requested.
       
       b) to answer to such a request furnishing a list of operating
       means of transport in accordance with the selection criteria.

       transport.
       
       c) to request means of transport on which space is available
       for a specific routing. Certain specific research criteria like
       date/time of operation, type of transport and space desired may
       be precised to limit the volume of information requested.
       
       d) to answer to such request furnishing a list of available
       means of transport in accordance with the selection criteria.
       Such an answer may comprise direct and/or combinations of means
