0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Work item
       quantity determination message (CONWQD) to be used in
       Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners
       involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

       There are occasions during the construction process when it is
       required to substantiate the quantities associated with
       specific sections of work. This message will be needed by
       various parties involved in the project to determine these
       quantity details.

1.1    Functional Definition

       Typically this message will be used between a contractor and
       the client's representative or other partners within the
       construction process, for justifying the work item quantities
       given in messages that describe the work items or their
       progress valuations.

1.2    Field of Application

       This message type may be applied for both national and
       international trade. It is based on universal practice and is
       not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       There are several examples within the construction process
       where one party is required to justify to another party the
       quantities per work item he has already given in earlier
       messages.
       
       A project may be subdivided into individual groupings of work,
       referred to as items and it is against the quantities of these
       items that a justification has to be given.
       
       Within the Construction industry there are numerous rules which
       govern this part of the process. Although efforts have been
       made to keep the design of the message generic, other potential
       users of this message are cautioned about the specific and
       original role for which it has been designed.
       
       This is only one of a number of messages being designed for the
       construction industry. This particular message refers to
       already described items of work or their progress valuation in
       earlier sent construction messages.
       
       This message is for verifiable and provable quantities per work
       item which include individual calculations with sub- and
       intermediate totals. The message contains the quantities and
       how they are assessed for each of the work items. For every
       work item the quantity per unit must be determined (except
       those with a flat rate, which are paid according to payment
       schedules). The unit of quantity is defined by common technical
       rules. Rules describe the way in which quantities are
       calculated. These use standard formulae.
