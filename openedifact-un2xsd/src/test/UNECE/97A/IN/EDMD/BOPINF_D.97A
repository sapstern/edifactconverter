0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Balance of
       payment information from customer message (BOPINF) to be used
       in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners
       involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       Message sent by a payee to its bank on receipt of one specified
       amount as a settlement of a transaction with a non-resident.
       The Balance of Payment (BOP) compiler has to be informed of the
       transaction via the payee's bank.

1.2    Field of Application

       The Balance of payment information from customer message may be
       used for both national and international applications. It is
       based on universal practice related to administration, commerce
       and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       In some countries the receipt of an external payment has to be
       reported to the BOP compiler via the customer's resident bank.
       
       It is assumed that the payee is informed about the receipt by a
       CREADV message. As far as this message contains relevant BOP
       data (for instance counterparties and the total amount) the
       payee - by referring in the BOPINF message to the CREADV
       message - refrain from reporting this data to its bank.
       
       For reporting to the BOP compiler the payee's bank has to
       combine the CREADV message and the related BOPINF message in
       order to fill in the BOPCUS message.
       
       The main part of the BOPINF message relates to additional BOP
       information related to corresponding transactions and unknown
       by the payee's bank.
       
       The message contains a main loop introduced by a LIN segment
       which is used to accommodate the reporting of a large number of
       transactions without repeating identical information.
       
       Each loop contains the information related to one transaction
       for which a CREADV has been received and for which a BOP
       information has been requested.
