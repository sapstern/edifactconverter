0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Delivery
       schedule message (DELFOR) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       WARNING! This version of the DELFOR is not upward compatible
       with versions prior to D96B.
       
       DELFOR is a message which is sent from a party who is planning
       the use or consumption of products to a  party who has to plan
       for the supply of the products. The message gives the
       requirements regarding details for short term delivery and/or
       medium to long scheduling for products. The scheduling can be
       used to authorize manufacturing and or the provision of
       materials.
       This is based on the terms and conditions defined in a purchase
       order or contract.

1.2    Field of Application

       The UN Standard Delivery Schedule Message may be applied for
       both national and international trade. It is based on universal
       commercial practice and is not dependent on the type of
       business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The Delivery schedule message shall be used to:
       
       - specify firm delivery dates and the quantities scheduled
       (using segment SCC, data element Delivery plan status
       indicator, coded (4017)=  "Firm".
       
       - specify forcasted production requirements (using SCC, data
       element Delivery plan status indicator, coded (4017)=either
       "commitment for manufacturing and material (2)" or "commitment
       for material (3)" or "planning/forecast (4)".
       
       - define the aspects that guarantee the synchronization between
       the supplying and receiving parties, thus allowing the supplier
       to plan for the resources necessary to fulfill customer
       requirements.
       
       The Delivery schedule message provides the option to use one of
       two scheduling methods.
       
       Method 1: delivery point driven
       This is when for a given delivery point a number of different
       products are to be delivered. This means that address
       information triggers product information. Usage of segment
       group 7 is consequently required for the specification of
       delivery points.
       
       Method 2: product driven
       This is when a given product is to be delivered to a number of
       different delivery points. This means that product information
       triggers address information,
       Consequently, segment group 7 is not to be used. Delivery point
       information shall be specified in segment group 22.
       
       An initiating Delivery schedule message is identified in the
       BGM with the "document/message name, coded (1001)" equal to
       "delivery schedule (241)" and "message function, coded (1225)"
       equal to "original (9)".
       
       A subsequent message may be used to replace the schedule
       completely (quantities and dates). This is identified in the
       BGM with the "message function, coded (1225)" equal to "replace
       (5)". The replacement of a schedule requires the new schedule
       to totally override the previous one.
       
       Alternatively the message may be used to partially alter the
       schedule. This is identified in the BGM with the "message
       function, coded (1225)" equal to "change (4)". Such alteration
       to the schedule shall adhere to the following recommendations:
       
       1.    All the date information in the QTY-DTM segment group
       shall be systematically used to identify the group to be
       changed.
       
       2.    How the information is to be changed:
       
       2.a. To change a quantity - where the date information matches
       the current quantity is replaced with the new quantity.
       
       2.b. To change a date - the current quantity has to be changed
       to zero and the new date information has to be given with the
       quantity from the former schedule.
       
       2.c. To change a date and quantity - the current quantity has
       to be changed to zero and the new date information has to be
       given with appropriate new quantity.
       
       2.d. To delete quantities and dates - the current quantity has
       to be changed to zero.
       
       2.e. To add quantities and dates - the new date information has
       to be given with the appropriate new quantity.
       
       3.    Unchanged dates and quantities - unchanged dates and
       quantities from the former schedule need to be resent.
       
       4.    Delivered quantities - delivered quantities are
       automatically eliminated from the schedule.
       
       The association to the previous Delivery schedule message is
       given by referencing the appropriate document/message number.
