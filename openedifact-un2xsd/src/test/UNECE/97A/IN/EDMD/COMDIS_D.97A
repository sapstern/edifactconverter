0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Commercial
       dispute message (COMDIS) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       A notice of commercial dispute against one or more invoices is
       usually raised by the buyer to notify the seller that something
       was found wrong with the goods delivered or the services
       rendered (goods damaged, delivery incomplete, delivery late,
       etc.). The dispute must be resolved before the related invoice
       can be settled.
       
       The message will be used to: - notify a dispute; - correspond
       about an existing dispute (structured information); - notify
       the settlement of a dispute.
       
       The message will serve at the same time as the dispute notice
       and as the dispute answer.
       
       Throughout this document, the term 'Buyer' refers to either the
       buyer or an Agent acting on behalf of the Buyer, and the term
       'Seller' refers either to the seller or an Agent acting on
       behalf of the Seller.

1.2    Field of Application

       This message may be applied for both national and international
       settlements. It is based on universal practice and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The usual flow of communication is from buyer to seller: the
       buyer sends a dispute notice to the seller, and the seller
       sends back a dispute answer to the buyer. Optionally, the
       seller may also send a credit note. An alternative flow of
       communication is from seller to buyer, e.g. if the seller
       disputes the payment of a related invoice.
       
       If part of the invoice is disputed, then as a consequence the
       whole invoice will be disputed.
       
       - One dispute may relate to one or more invoices/credit notes;
       - One dispute may relate to one or more payments;
       - One dispute must relate to one seller;
       - One dispute must relate to one buyer.
