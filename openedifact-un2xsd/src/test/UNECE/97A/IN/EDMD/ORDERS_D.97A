4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Data Segment Clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the Segment
       Table which indicate mandatory, conditional and repeating
       requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole
       message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and
       implementation of the message: 
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format
       'yymmdd'/'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction
       agree that there is a functional requirement for an alternative
       format. Periods should be specified as whole numbers
       representing the required period as indicated in the format
       qualifier (weeks, months, etc.) 
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not
       be included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent
       segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the
       trigger segment of a group.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as
       this inhibits automatic processing.

       by means of its name and number and when necessary its
       function.

0030   DTM, Date/time/period
       A segment specifying general dates and, when relevant, times
       related to the whole message. The segment must be specified at
       least once to identify the order date.
       Examples of the use of this DTM segment are: Lead times that
       apply to the whole of the Order and, if no schedule is to be
       specified, the delivery date.
       The Date/time/period segment within other Segment group should
       be used whenever the date/time/period requires to be logically
       related to another specified data item. e.g. Payment due date
       is specified within the PAT Segment group.

0040   PAI, Payment instructions
       A segment requesting or confirming conditions of payment,
       guarantee and method of payment for the whole order. An example

          where possible only the coded form of the party ID should be
          specified e.g. The Buyer and Seller are known to each other,
