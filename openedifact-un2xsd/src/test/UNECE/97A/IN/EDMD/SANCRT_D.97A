0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the International
       movement of goods governmental regulatory message (SANCRT) to
       be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading
       partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       The SANCRT message permits a commercial operator to apply to a
       national agency for the issue of a certificate, permit,
       authorization etc. in respect of products to be imported or
       exported. It further permits the issuing authority to transmit
       to the applicant and to the exporting or importing country's
       relevant national authority, (e.g. Customs, Agriculture etc.)
       the details of the certificate, permit or authorization in
       respect of those products thus facilitating the import/export
       clearance of the consignment whilst ensuring that all
       certificate, permit, authorization requirements are met.

1.2    Field of Application

       The International movement of goods governmental regulatory
       message may be used for both national and international
       applications. It is based on universal practice related to
       administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on
       the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       This message may be used nationally and internationally by
       government authorities and commercial entities requesting,
       issuing or verifying permits, certificates, authorizations,
       licences, etc. in respect of imported and exported goods.
       Typically the message would be used:
       
       a) by an importer or exporter to request an issuing authority
       to issue a certificate, permit, etc.;
       
       b) by an issuing authority to inform the applicant that a
       certificate, permit, etc. has been issued;
       
       c) by an issuing authority to inform the national Customs
       authority of the details of the consignment that has been
       certified, licensed, etc.;
       
       d) by an issuing authority to inform an overseas authority
       (e.g. Food and Drug, Agriculture etc.) of the details of a
       consignment that has been certified, licensed, etc.
       
       The message is intended to cover a wide range of products
       requiring authorization, certification, etc. for a wide variety
       of reasons (e.g. sanitary/phytosanitary certification,
       certificate of origin, certificate of authenticity, import and
       export permits or licenses for various goods).
       
       - The message may be used for either imported or exported
       products. In both cases a single message is used for a product
       type consigned from a single consignor to a single consignee.
       
       - A certificate may cover several product items. A certificate
       should however be limited to product items of the same type or
       category.
       
       - All products covered by a certificate are transported
       together on the same transport vehicle or vehicle set at the
       same time. Transport can however occur over more than one
       stage.
       
       - The product may be in zero, one or more containers.
       
       - Inclusion of standard endorsements or generic textual
       declarations in the certificate is discouraged. It is
       recommended that these and other certification protocol
       requirements be accounted for outside the certificate in
       individual trading partner agreements.
