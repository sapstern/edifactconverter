0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Receiving
       advice message (RECADV) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       This message is to address the business needs related to the
       goods receipt. This message is used to report the physical
       receipt of goods. The message allows for the reporting of
       discrepancies in products, quantities, terms, packages, etc.
       
       The message may contain only the information that the received
       consignment is completely in line with the consignment
       information given in the Despatch advice message. In case there
       is no detail to be provided.
       
       The message may inform about the discrepancies:
       - between the received consignment and consignment information
       given in the Despatch advice message.
       - between the received goods and the ordered goods in the
       ORDERS, DELFOR or DELJIT information.

1.2    Field of Application

       The Receiving advice message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The message is initiated by the party which received the goods.
       The message relates to a single or to multiple receiving
       points. It may cover a number of different items or packages.

3.1    Standard terms and definitions

       See UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.6 UN/ECE UNSM - General
       Introduction, Section 2.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

       This section is provided to give clarification and further
       explanation to the usage of segments within the message
       structure.

4.1    Data Segment Clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the Segment
       Table which indicate mandatory, conditional and repeating
       requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole
       message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and
       implementation of the message:
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format
       'yymmdd'/'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction
       agree that there is a functional requirement for an alternative
       format.
       Periods should be specified as whole numbers representing the
       required period as indicated in the format qualifier (weeks,
       months, etc.)
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
       
       Care must be taken to avoid the conflicting use of qualifiers.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as
       this inhibits automatic processing.
