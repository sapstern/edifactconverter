0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Price/sales
       catalogue message (PRICAT) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1  | Functional Definition

       A message to enable the transmission of information regarding
       pricing and catalogue details for goods and services offered by
       a seller to a buyer.
       The message can also be sent by a buyer to a seller. This may
       be a response (acceptance or rejection) to a previously
       received price/sales catalogue message, or a notification of
       negotiated prices.

1.2    Field of Application

       The UN Standard Price/Sales Catalogue Message may be applied
       for both national and international trade. It is based on
       universal commercial practice and is not dependent on the type
       of business or industry.

1.3  | Principles

       - A Price/Sales Catalogue Message Pricing-group or item may
       refer to either goods items or services.
       
       - The Price items are structured together according to
       industrial or commercial requirements.
       
       - The sales and delivery conditions within a Price/Sales
       Catalogue Message may refer to:
       
       . all product/service items of the Price/Sales Catalogue
       Message, 
       . a group of product/service items, 
       . a single product/service item in the message, 
       . within a single product/service item to different price basis
       occurrences.
       
       - A Price/Sales Catalogue Message may contain product and price
       information, as well as sales conditions.
       
       - The Price Item Line may identify the component parts of the
       price item.
       
       When  using the price/sales catalogue message to provide a
       response, the message sender may specify this information in
       one of two ways:
       
       - The total acceptance or rejection of a previous price/sales
       catalogue message;
       
       - The rejection of information either at a product group level
       or at an individual product level.

3.     TERMS AND DEFINITIONS

3.1    Standard terms and definitions

       See UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.6 UN/ECE UNSM - General
       Introduction, Section 2.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Data Segment Clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the Segment
       Table which indicate mandatory, conditional and repeating
       requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole
       message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and
       implementation of the message:
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format
       'yymmdd'/'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction
       agree that there is a functional requirement for an alternative
       format. Periods should be specified as whole numbers
       representing the required period as indicated in the
       date/time/period format (weeks, months, etc.).
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not
       be included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent
       segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the
       trigger segment of the group 
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as
       this inhibits automatic processing.

4.1.1  Header section

       PRICAT.
       
       Note: Price/sales catalogue messages conforming to this
       document must contain the following data in segment UNH,
       composite S009:

       Data element  0065 PRICAT
                     0052 D
                     0054 97A

0030   DTM, Date/time/period
       A segment specifying general dates and, when relevant, times
       related to the whole message. The segment must be specified at
       least once to identify the Price/sales catalogue document date.
       
       Examples of the use of this DTM segment are: Lead times that
       apply to the whole Price/Sales catalogue or expiration
       date/time of the Price/sales catalogue.
       
       The Date/time/period segment within other Segment groups should
       be used whenever the date/time/period requires to be logically

          It is recommended that where possible only the coded form of
          the party ID should be specified, e.g. The sender and the
          receiver are known to each other, thus only the coded ID is
          required, but the other parties specified in the message may
