General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Customs
       declaration message (CUSDEC) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       This Customs Declaration Message (CUSDEC) permits the transfer
       of data from a declarant to a customs administration for the
       purpose of meeting legislative and/or operational requirements
       in respect of the declaration of goods for import, export or
       transit. The message may also be used, for example :
       
        - to transmit data from an exporter in one country to an
       importer in another country; 
        - to transmit consignment data from one customs administration
       to another;
        - to transmit data from a customs authority to other
       governments agencies and/or interested administrations.
       - to transmit data from a declarant to the appropriate data
       collection agency on the movement of goods between statistical
       territories.

1.2    Field of Application

       This message may be applied for both national and international
       trade. It is based on universal practice and is not dependent
       on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       This message incorporates the necessary transport, statistical
       and customs information. Provision has also been made for the
       inclusion of appropriate commercial information which may be
       accepted by customs in lieu of supporting documentation.
       
       The design principles adopted allow for referencing one or more
       commercial documents pertaining to the same declaration and for
       the grouping of document lines into a single customs item. A
       customs item consists of the grouping of those document lines
       having the same customs characteristics (e.g. tariff number,
       declared use, etc). The message correspondingly permits the use
       of single or multi-packaging concepts and their identification
       to a customs item.
