0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Purchase
       order change request message (ORDCHG) to be used in Electronic
       Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

       A message from the buyer to the seller, specifying details of
       the buyer's request to change a purchase order.

1.2    Field of Application

       The UN Standard Purchase Order Change Message may be applied
       for both national and international trade. It is based on
       universal commercial practice and is not dependent on the type
       of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       A buyer may request to change, or eventually cancel one or more
       goods items or services.
       
       A purchase order change request may refer to goods items or
       services related to one or more delivery schedules, call-offs,
       etc.
       
       A purchase order change request for cross-border transactions
       may contain additional information for customs and/or
       statistical purposes.
       
       A purchase order change request may contain details for
       transport and destination as well as delivery patterns.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Data Segment Clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the Segment
       Table which indicate mandatory, conditional and repeating
       requirements.
       
       For guidance, the following principles serve to remove
       ambiguity in the application of an EDI Purchase Order Change.
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format
       'yymmdd'/'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction
       agree that there is a functional requirement for an alternative
       format. Periods should be specified as whole numbers
       representing the required period as indicated in the format
       qualifier (weeks, months, etc.).
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not
       be included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent
       segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the
       trigger segment of a group.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as
       this inhibits automatic processing.

4.1.1  Header section

       Information to be provided in the Header section:

       The heading section of ORDCHG message contains the same
       segments in the same sequence as the ORDERS and ORDRSP
       messages. The actual use of these segments in the ORDCHG
       message is depending upon the value of the MESSAGE FUNCTION
       CODE (D/E 1225) of the BGM segment.

0010   UNH, Message header
       A service segment starting and uniquely identifying a message.
       The message type code for the Purchase order change request
       message is ORDCHG.
       
       Note: Purchase order change request messages conforming to this
       document must contain the following data in segment UNH,
       composite S009:

       Data element  0065 ORDCHG
                     0052 D
                     0054 97A

       A segment specifying general dates and, when relevant, times
       related to the whole order or order change message. The segment
       must be specified at least once to identify the order change
       date.
       
       Examples of the use of this DTM segment are: Lead times that
       apply to the whole of the order and, if no schedule is to be
       specified, the delivery date.
       
       The Date/time/period segment within other Segment group should
       be used whenever the date/time/period requires to be logically
       related to another specified data item. e.g. schedule dates are
       specified within Segment group 47.

0040   PAI, Payment instructions

Semantic Notes 

These notes are not exhaustive, they are there only for clarification.

The following Semantic Notes concern the use of the BGM segment.

If an Order is to be cancelled, use of Message Function Code '1'
indicates that the transmitted message requests a complete
cancellation of a referenced Purchase Order. All data is to be
cancelled.

If an Order is to be changed, use of Message function code '4'
indicates that the transmitted message requests specified changes of
the referred Purchase Order.

If an Order is to be replaced, use of Message Function Code '5'
indicates that the transmitted message effects a complete replacement
of the referenced Purchase Order. All data are to be replaced in their
entirety by that in the current message.

If an Order response with changes is to be confirmed, use of Message
Function Code '6' indicates the confirmation by the buyer of
amendments proposed by the seller.

If an Order is to be duplicated, use of Message Function Code '7'
indicates that the transmitted message is an exact duplication of a
previous Purchase Order Change Request.

If an order is to be cancelled and to be re-issued, use of Message
Function Code '17' indicates that the transmitted message effects a
complete cancellation of the referenced Purchase Order, and that an
Purchase Order will be issued.

If only the heading section of an order is to be replaced, use of
Message Function Code '20' indicates that the transmitted message
effects changes in Heading Section data only. The complete Heading
Section data is transmitted to replace all data previously sent.
Detail and Summary Section data remain unchanged.

If only item detail and summary is to be replaced, use of Message
Function Code '21' indicates that the transmitted message effects
changes in Detail Section data, and may affect Summary data. Heading
Section data remains unchanged.

To indicate the last and final release of an order, use Message
Function Code '22'.

If an order is to be placed on hold, use of Message Function Code '23'
indicates that the processing against the referenced purchase order
has been suspended until further release information. An order placed
on hold is subsequently released by Message Function Code 'XX'.

If an Order is to be accepted without amendment, use of Message
Function Code '29' indicates that the buyer accepts the reference
message without amendments.

If an order is to be Changed in detail section, use of Message
Function Code '36' indicates that the transmitted message requests
specified changes in data in the Detail section. Changes are indicated
at the line item level.

LIN, Line Item, Group SG 25 The following Semantic Notes concern the
use of the LIN segment and D/E 1229 Action Request Code for segment
group 25.

If a line item is requested to be added, use of Action Request Code
'1' indicates that the line item is to be added to the Purchase Order
as a new or additional item. All required data must be transmitted.

If a line item is requested to be deleted, use of Action Request Code
'2' indicates that the line item is to be deleted from the Purchase
Order. The item is cancelled completely. No other data for the line
item need be transmitted.

If a line item is requested to be changed, use of Action Request Code
'3' indicates that the line item is to be changed. The data
transmitted in the LIN segment, and segments attached to the LIN,
replaces that previously held for the order item.

If a line item is not requested to be amended, use of Action Request
Code '11' indicates that the line item has not changed and no action
has been taken, and the item is transmitted for information purposes
and/or positioning.
