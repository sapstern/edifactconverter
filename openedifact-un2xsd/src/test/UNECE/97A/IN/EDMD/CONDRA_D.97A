0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Drawing
       administration message (CONDRA) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       The message will be used for the administration of each
       exchange of a set of engineering/CAD files. It will give
       additional information about the files; for example, their
       nature, a list of their contents and technical information
       necessary to interpret them.
       
       The whole process of exchanging engineering or CAD (Computer
       Aided Design) files between different parties within projects
       will be supported by EDIFACT messages. The message CONDRA is
       one of these messages.

1.2    Field of Application

       This message type may be applied for both national and
       international trade. It is based on universal practice and is
       not dependent on the type of business or industry.
       
       The following descriptions refer to the exchange of
       engineering/CAD files, but do not exclude any other type of
       "native" files, e.g. files originating from software packages
       and tools like word-processing, spreadsheet, DTP (Desk Top
       Publishing), graphics and so on.

1.3    Principles

       CONDRA is the EDIFACT message to administer the exchange of
       engineering/CAD files. The message itself does not consist of
       any engineering or graphical information. This information will
       be transferred within files written in existing standard
       graphical exchange formats or native formats, referred to
       within the message as external file reference to identify each
       of these files. The nature of the engineering files and its
       content is not relevant for the syntax of the EDIFACT message. 
        
       All types of engineering/CAD files may be exchanged during a
       project's life cycle. The naming/structuring conventions,
       including project organisation and system environments can be
       defined in the EDIFACT message CONDRO (Drawing Organisation). 
        
       CONDRA will refer to the message CONDRO, previously received by
       the business parties, if there is additional information
       required about the project organisation, system environment and
       naming/structuring convention.

       This segment conveys exchange information like the number of
       engineering/CAD files and their total size (volume) that form
       part of the exchange of this message and to which this message
       refers.


0080   Segment group 1:  RFF-DOC-DTM-FTX
       A group of segments used for quoting references and their
       relevant dates applicable to the message. For the building
       industry the following recommendation is given: in the first
       occurrence of this segment group the project references, if
       relevant, can be given, in order to identify the project to
       which this message  relates. In any subsequent  recurrence of
       this segment group, references to other messages (e.g. the
       original CONDRO when it is an update) or documents, relevant to
       this message, may be quoted.

0090      RFF, Reference
          A segment for quoting the unique references which can be the
          project number to which this message is relevant, or, in the
          case of a reference to another message or document, that
          message or document's unique identifier.

0100      DOC, Document/message details

0140      NAD, Name and address
          A segment identifying name and address of a party, in coded
          or clear form, and its function relevant to the Drawing
          Administration Message. This is to identify each partner
          involved in the future exchange of CAD files. It is
          recommended that where possible only the coded form of the
          party ID should be specified.

0150      LOC, Place/location identification
          A segment giving more specific location information of the
          party specified in the NAD segment e.g. internal

          internal project number or a DP number.

0200         RFF, Reference
             In this segment specific internal references will be
             quoted, as and when required.

0210         DTM, Date/time/period
             A segment specifying the date and/or time details related
             to the party's specific internal references.


0220      Segment group 4:  CTA-COM-LOC
          A group of segments giving contact details of the specific
          person or department within the party identified in the NAD
          segment.

0230         CTA, Contact information

             for the contact specified in the CTA segment.

0250         LOC, Place/location identification
             This segment specifies the location of the contact
             specified in the previous CTA segment. In large
             organisations and construction projects it is possible
             that persons are not necessarily on the same internal
             site or construction site specified in the previous LOC
             segment in segment group 2. This segment also enables the
             specification of a more accurate internal site location.


0260   Segment group 5:  EFI-CED-RFF-DTM-QTY-SG6
       A group of segments that refers through an external file
       identification to each of the external engineering/CAD files
       and giving additional information about each of the files.

0270      EFI, External file link identification
          This segment will identify the external files by indicating
          the file name, file number and its sequence number in an
          exchange.

0290      RFF, Reference
          A segment giving reference related to the file, identified
          by the previous EFI segment. This reference number is
          specific to the sender, and the receivers may be informed
          about its full meaning through another message (e.g. for the
          building industry message CONDRO) if this feature is used.

0300      DTM, Date/time/period
          This segment will convey the date/time details of the
          external engineering/CAD file.

                            LOC-DIM-MEA-SG7
          A group of segments that records more detailed information
          about the contents of the external engineering/CAD file is
          identified in the previous EFI segment. This information is
          organised hierarchically. First, each hierarchy is
          identified, followed by the type of hierarchy.

0330         BII, Structure identification
             This segment will, through a structured index code,
             uniquely identify the level described in the following
             segments.

0340         GIS, General indicator
             This segment is used to define the level type identified
             by the previous BII segment, like, for example, drawing
             sheet, view, layer group, and layer, but also phase etc.

0350         DTM, Date/time/period
             Date and time details of the level identified in the
             previous BII segment.

             The scale used can be quoted in this segment.


0460         Segment group 7:  RFF-SG8-SG9
             For each of the levels that are identified in the
             previous BII segment it is possible to refer to other
             messages/documents on other levels of the structure of
             the engineering/CAD file identified in the previous EFI
             segment. It is also possible to refer to other levels
             which are part of a different engineering/CAD file than
             the one identified in the previous EFI segment. If
             needed, here should also be made a reference to a
             contractual document or to a revision number.

0470            RFF, Reference
                An ID number will be used to refer to either another
                message/document or to another engineering/CAD file.
                If needed, here should also be made a reference to a
                contractual document or to a revision number.


0480            Segment group 8:  DOC-DTM
                If the reference number quoted in the previous RFF
                segment is a reference to another message/document,
                this segment group is used to give more details about
                this message/document.

0490               DOC, Document/message details
                   The details of the message/document referred to are

                   to are quoted in this segment.


0510            Segment group 9:  SEQ-BII-RFF-GIS-DTM-IMD
                This segment group will be used when a reference is
                made to another specific level in the structure of an
                engineering/CAD file.
                If in the previous RFF segment a standard dummy value
                is quoted, the level referred to is part of the
                engineering/CAD file identified in the previous EFI
                segment. If, however, in the previous RFF segment any
                other value is quoted, the level described in the
                following BII segment is part of the engineering/CAD
                file identified by the ID number.

0520               SEQ, Sequence details
                   A segment identifying the beginning of a CAD-file

                   Through an "index system", updates (versions) can
                   be recorded in a reference number. In this segment
                   the version of the level referred to can be quoted.

0550               GIS, General indicator
                   This segment is used to define the level type
                   identified in the previous BII segment; like, for
                   example, drawing sheet, view, layer group and
                   layer.

0560               DTM, Date/time/period
                   Date/time details of the level that is referred to
