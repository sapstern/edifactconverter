General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Vessel call
       information message (CALINF) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       Notice from a liner agent to a stevedore providing information
       concerning the expected arrival of a vessel and the expected
       cargo operations.
       
       This message is part of a total set of container-related
       messages. These messages serve to facilitate the intermodal
       handling of containers by streamlining the information
       exchange.
       The business scenario for the container messages is clarified
       in a separate document, called: 'Guide to the scenario of
       EDIFACT container messages'.

1.2    Field of Application

       The Vessel call information message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       In the context of the 'Guide to the scenario of EDIFACT
       container messages' (as referred to at the start of section 1)
       the following guidelines, rules and functionality apply to this
       Vessel call information message:
       
       *   A message will contain information on only one means of
       transport/conveyance.
       
       *   Separate messages (Vessel call information message and
       Vessel departure message) will be used for the means of
       transport in order to cater for opening and closing of the
       information exchange related to that means of transport.
       Updates for these messages may be sent.
       
       *  The message contents can be uniquely identified by a
       combination of the following message level data elements for
       the Container Logistics scenario:
       -  Voyage number or indication of sea transport (TDT and/or
       RFF)
       -  Vessel radio call sign (TDT)
       -  Shipping line (TDT)
       
       *  Both the expected date and/or time of arrival and the
       expected date and/or time of departure of the vessel can be
       given.
       
       *  For planning purposes, information on the expected handling
       of containers as well as on certain goods item descriptions can
       be completed.
