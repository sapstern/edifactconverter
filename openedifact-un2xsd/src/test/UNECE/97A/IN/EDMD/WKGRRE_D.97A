0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Work grant
       request message (WKGRRE) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       A message specifying details of requests to a governmental
       authority from an employer for workers who need a work grant or
       permit.

1.2    Field of Application

       The Work grant request message may be used for both national
       and international applications. It is based on universal
       practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and
       is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The message is to provide detailed information of one or more
       requests.
       
       A Work grant request message is transmitted from an employer to
       a governmental agency.
       
       A Work grant request message may contain requested detailed
       information about a person (i.e: the address, the profession,
       the location of the job and the remuneration).
       
       A Work grant request message may also be used for a
       modification or an extension of an existing work grant request.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Data Segment Clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the Segment
       Table which indicate mandatory, conditional and repeating
       requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole
       message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and
       implementation of the message:
       
       All specified dates and times should be in the format 'yymmdd'
       or 'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction agree
       that there is a functional requirement for an alternative
       format. Periods should be specified as whole numbers
       representing the required period as indicated in the format
       qualifier (weeks, months, etc.)
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not
       be included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent
       segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the
       trigger segment of a group.
