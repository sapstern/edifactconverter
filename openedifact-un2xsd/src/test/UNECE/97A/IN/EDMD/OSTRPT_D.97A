0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Order status
       report message (OSTRPT) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       A message between a buyer or buyer's agent and a seller or
       seller's agent reporting status information on the current
       status of a previously sent order(s). This may be a reply to an
       order status enquiry or a report as agreed between the
       partners.

1.2    Field of Application

       The Order status report message may be used for both national
       and international applications. It is based on universal
       practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and
       is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       This message covers one seller and one buyer and may relate to:
       
       - one enquiry
       
       - one or more purchase orders
       
       - specific lines within purchase orders
       
       The status can not trigger any action by the receiver of the
       message. For example, if the status is 'ready for shipment', it
       can not be used as a despatch advice information. A DESADV
       message, or an equivalent document, has to be sent as well.
       
       This message can only be used to provide status information.

       Introduction, Section 2.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Data Segment Clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the Segment
       Table which indicate mandatory, conditional and repeating
       requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole
       message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and
       implementation of the message:
       
       - All specified dates/times should be in the format
       'yymmdd'/'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction
       agree that there is a functional requirement for an alternative
       format. Periods should be specified as whole numbers
       representing the required period as indicated in the format
       qualifier (weeks, months, etc.)
       
       - Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible. 
       
       - Conditional data that is required in the message should be
       omitted.
       
       - Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent
       segments does not conflict with the segment qualifier of the
       trigger segment of a group.
       
       - Free text information within the message should be avoided as
       this inhibits automatic processing.
