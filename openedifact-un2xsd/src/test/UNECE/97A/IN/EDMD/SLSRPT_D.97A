0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Sales data
       report message (SLSRPT) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1  | Functional Definition

       A message to enable the conveyance of product activity related
       to the sale of products or services, such as the activity
       location, date, time or period, quantity, pricing, monetary
       amount, market sector, involved parties and other data enabling
       various sales analysis processes. Such activity information
       allows the recipient to perform statistical and quantitative
       analysis in support of production, planning, marketing,
       replenishment, and other processes.

1.2    Field of Application

       The Sales data report message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3  | Principles

       This message provides product activity related to the sale of
       products or services in two mutually exclusive methods. These
       two methods are represented by segment groups 5 and 9 within
       the detail area.
       - The first method is reporting activity by line item within a
       specific location, e.g. reporting each product sold within a
       specific location. This method will utilise segment group 5 and
       its subordinate groups. If segment group 5 is used segment
       group 9 shall not be used.
       - The second method is reporting activity by location within
       each line item, e.g. reporting each location and quantity sold
       for a particular product. This method will utilise segment
       group 9 and its subordinate groups. If segment group 9 is used
       segment group 5 shall not be used.
       
       The message may be sent from a buyer, seller, distributor,
       public warehouse or third party to their supplier, distributor,
       manufacturer, or other third party.  It is assumed the
       recipient will perform analytical processing of the data in
       support of other business processes such as marketing,
       replenishment, or product development.
       
       This message provides the recipient with detailed information
       relative to a specific product such as: 
       
       - Location of the activity, e.g. sale or product movement.
       - Specific parties involved, e.g. name of company sold to.
       - Date or period of the activity.
       - Activity price, e.g. selling price.
       - Activity quantity, e.g. quantity sold.
       - Promotion in effect.
       - Value of the sales.
       - Periodical turnover.
       - Additional product information, e.g. product groups or id
       numbers.
       - Identification of market segment or channel of distribution.
       - Summarisation of information for various locations, e.g.
       sales for all locations in a region.

       Introduction, Section 2.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Data Segment Clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the Segment
       Table which indicate mandatory, conditional and repeating
       requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole
       message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and
       implementation of the message:
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format
       'yymmdd'/'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction
       agree that there is a functional requirement for an alternative
       format. Periods should be specified as whole numbers
       representing the required period as indicated in the format
       qualifier (weeks, months, etc.).
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
       Due to the high volume of data that will be usually transmitted
       in the Sales Data Report message, it is highly recommended to
       use codes for products and locations.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not
       be included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent
       segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the
       trigger segment of a group.

4.1.1  Header section

       Information to be provided in the Header section:

0010   UNH, Message header

       SLSRPT.
       
       Note: Sales data report messages conforming to this document
       must contain the following data in segment UNH, composite S009:

       Data element  0065 SLSRPT
                     0052 D
                     0054 97A

          report and the recipient is mandatory for the sales data
          report message. It is recommended that where possible only
          the coded form of the party ID should be specified e.g. the
          sender and receiver of the report are known to each other,
          thus only the coded ID is required, but when a new address
