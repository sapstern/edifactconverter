0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Container
       stock report message (COEDOR) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       A message to report containers that are in stock of the sending
       party (i.e., a terminal, depot or container freight station).
       
       This message is part of a total set of container-related
       messages. These messages serve to facilitate the intermodal
       handling of containers by streamlining the information
       exchange.
       The business scenario for the container messages is clarified
       in a separate document, called: 'Guide to the scenario of
       EDIFACT container messages'.

1.2    Field of Application

       The Container stock report message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       Business area: 
       Pre- and on-carriage transport of containers/equipment 
        
       Sending functions include: 
       Container terminal (seaside), inland terminal (landside),
       container freight station, container depot
        
       Receiving functions include: 
       Shipping agent, logistic center, freight forwarder 
        
       In the context of the 'Guide to the scenario of EDIFACT
       container messages' (as referred to at the start of section 1)
       the following guidelines, rules and functionality apply to this
       Container stock report message:
        
       *   The message contents can be uniquely identified by a
       combination of the following data elements:
       - message sender, coded (NAD) 
       - stock check date/time (DTM) 
        
       A combination of the following data elements can be used in
       order to relate to business data contained in the Container
       acceptance order:
       - ordering customer, coded (NAD) 
       - ordering customer agent, coded (NAD) 
       - container announcement reference (being the acceptance order
       reference) (EQD/RFF) 
        
       *   The message can be sent on a regular basis; e.g. once or
       twice per day.
        
       *   One message may contain several containers identified by
       their prefix and serial number.
       
       *   For each container its stack position can be given,
       including the date and time of its checking by the stock
       reporter, and the date/time on which the container was
       delivered at the stock keeper's place.
        
       *   Also the transport status (= export, import, transhipment
       or continental), full/empty indication and the condition
       (damage) of the container can be specified.
        
       *   Depending on the transport status of the container
       additional information on the container can be given, such as
       carrier agent's reference, (seagoing) vessel, (sea) voyage
       number/indication and port of discharge.
        
       *   Goods item details cannot be completed.
