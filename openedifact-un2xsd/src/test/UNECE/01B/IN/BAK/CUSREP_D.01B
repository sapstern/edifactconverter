0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Customs
       conveyance report message (CUSREP) to be used in Electronic
       Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       This Customs Conveyance Report Message (CUSREP) permits the
       transfer of data from a carrier to a Customs administration for
       the purpose of meeting Customs reporting requirements in
       respect of the means of transport on which cargo is carried.

1.2    Field of application

       The Customs conveyance report message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       It is envisaged that the Customs Conveyance Report Message may
       be initiated by the carrier to report details of the means of
       transport on which cargo is conveyed to a Customs
       administration. The message is transmitted upon arrival of the
       vessel, flight, etc., or where national legislation permits,
       prior to arrival. The data provides a means of establishing the
       basis of a cargo inventory report for the conveyance in
       question. Details of individual consignments carried on the
       conveyance will be subsequently transmitted to Customs using a
       CUSCAR message or a series of such messages. It also allows
       Customs to undertake selectivity processing in order to select
       high risk conveyances and shipments requiring examination.
       
       The message embodies reporting requirements of all modes of
       transport. Each message covers the data requirements for one
       conveyance. The message may be used for reporting empty
       containers as well as numbers of passengers and crew.
