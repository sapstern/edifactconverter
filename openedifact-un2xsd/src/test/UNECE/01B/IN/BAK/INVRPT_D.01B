0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Inventory
       report message (INVRPT) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

       This paper provides the definition of the United Nations
       Standard Inventory Report Message to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange between trading partners.

1.1    Functional definition

       A message specifying information relating to held inventories.
       The Inventory report message is intended to be used in either
       direction between trading partners.

1.2    Field of application

       The Inventory report message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The exchanged information will relate to inventories of raw
       materials, manufactured articles, or other stockable items, and
       can be exchanged between a manufacturer and distributor
       (wholesaler), or manufacturer and consignment holder, etc.
       
       The message includes functionality to differentiate classes of
       inventory, and to permit financial valuation of inventories
       facilitating price protection claims, auditing, statutory
       declarations, planning of production and deliveries, etc.
       
       The specified quantities relating to a product can indicate
       opening stock, closing stock, and goods movement (receipts or
       withdrawals) of held inventory, for a given time frame.
       
       The specified quantities can relate directly to a product or
       package, and may be sub-detailed within different groups or
       classes, e.g., batch, age, valuation, location, etc.
       
       For every specified quantity it is possible to indicate the
       relative package identifications of the physical units
       involved.

       Introduction, Section 2.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment
       table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating
       requirements.
       
       The following guide-lines and principles apply to the whole
       message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and
       implementation of the message:
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format 'ccyymmdd'/
       'hhmm' unless all the parties involved in the transaction agree
       that there is a functional requirement for an alternative form.
       Periods should be specified as whole numbers representing the
       required period as indicated to the format qualifier (weeks,
       months, etc.).
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not
       be included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent
       segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the
       trigger segment of the group.
