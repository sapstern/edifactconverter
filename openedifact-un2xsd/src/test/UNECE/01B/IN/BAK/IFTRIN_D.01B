General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Forwarding
       and transport rate information message (IFTRIN) to be used in
       Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners
       involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The function of this message is to request transport rate
       information and to answer to such a request.

1.2    Field of application

       The Forwarding and transport rate information message may be
       used for both national and international applications. It is
       based on universal practice related to administration, commerce
       and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       This message may be used:
       
       a) to request transport rate information for a specific
       routing. Certain specific research criteria such as date/time
       of application, means of transport and type of rate desired may
       be specified to limit the volume of information requested.
       
       b) to answer to such a request, furnishing a list of rates
       selected in accordance with the selection criteria.
       
       c) to request transport additional precision concerning a
       specific rate.
       
       d) to answer to such a request, furnishing the additional
       information requested.
       
       The transport sub-working group (D4) has developed
       recommendations for a harmonised implementation of this message
       through its subgroup ITIGG (International Transport
       Implementation Guidelines Group).
       Users implementing the message are strongly advised to apply
       these recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4
       secretariat.
