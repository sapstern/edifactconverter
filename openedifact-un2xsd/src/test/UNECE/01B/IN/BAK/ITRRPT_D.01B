0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the In transit
       report detail message (ITRRPT) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message specifying to a delivery party, the details of goods
       within grouped consignments despatched by the delivering party.
       This message is used in a multi-step transportation process
       involving only consignors, grouping centres and consignees.
       
       A grouping centre (consolidation point) is a logistic point
       where goods are moved from one means of transport to another,
       to optimize transport cost. This message is not to be used to
       identify additional services related to the despatched goods
       (warehousing, packaging, etc.) which may be provided by the
       third party at the same location along with the Grouping
       service.

1.2    Field of application

       The In transit report detail message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       An In Transit Report Detail message always relates to one or
       many Despatch Advice messages sent to the parties concerned.
       This message refers to the goods identified in the referenced
       Despatch Advice messages
       
       When the recipient of the message is a grouping centre the
       message allows the grouping centre to consolidate consignments
       received from one or more original consignors or other grouping
       centres and despatch them to another grouping centre or to the
       consignee.
       
       When the recipient of the message is the consignee, it allows
       the consignee to match this message with the corresponding
       Despatch Advice messages already received from the
       consignor(s). In case of differences, the message allows the
       consignee to identify variances caused by a split consignment
       or by missing goods.
       
       The Cargo/goods handling and movement message (HANMOV) has been
       designed to identify additional handling services related to
       the despatched goods, such as storage or (re-)packaging.
       
       An ITRRPT message specifies the details of despatched goods
       (possibly re-grouped), corresponding to one or more original
       despatch advices; the references to the consignment(s) by which
       they transported can be included (the seller's and buyer's
       perspective). The message does not necessarily provide full
       consignment details as required for transport purposes ( the
       carrier's perspective).
       
       The message refers to goods despatched on a single unit of
       transport (e.g. a single truck, a single railway wagon etc.).
       
       The sender of the message may be:
       
       . The consignor; in this case the message may refer to several
       buyers and consignees, but to only one seller.
       
       . A grouping centre; in this case the message may refer to
       several buyers, consignors, consignees and sellers.
       
       The recipient of the message may be:
       
       . A grouping centre; in this case the message may refer to
       several sellers, consignors, consignees and buyers.
       
       . The consignee; in this case the message may refer to several
       sellers, but only one buyer and one consignee.
       
       The following diagram illustrates the information flows.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment
       table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating
       requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole
       message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and
       implementation of the message:
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format
       'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the
       transaction agree that there is a functional requirement for an
       alternative format.
       Periods should be specified as whole numbers representing the
       required period as indicated in the format qualifier (weeks,
       months, etc.)
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
       
       Care must be taken to avoid the conflicting use of qualifiers.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as
       this inhibits automatic processing.
