0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Direct
       payment valuation message (CONDPV) to be used in Electronic
       Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       This message is the instruction by the contractor to the party
       responsible for payments, to pay the subcontractors for work
       completed.

1.2    Field of application

       The Direct payment valuation message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.
       
       The following descriptions refer to the construction industry
       as an example, but do not exclude other business sectors'
       implementation.

1.3    Principles

       This message is designed to be used to support the business
       process of communicating the value of progress against groups
       of work items which make up a construction project.
       
       Within the construction industry, it is common practice to
       subcontract "packages" of work to other parties. It is also
       common practice for this type of work to be paid for on a
       "phased" basis.
       
       This message will be raised by the party responsible for
       overseeing the subcontracted work. It will contain the identity
       of the subcontractor and the value of payment approved for the
       current payment period. The recipient of this message,
       typically the client, will treat this as an instruction to pay.
       
       The identity of the various subcontracted parties and details
       of their bank accounts, etc, will have been established at the
       start of the project in an appropriate message.
       
       As it is possible for new subcontractors to be nominated during
       the life of a project provision has been made within this
       message to record the basic details about such a subcontractor.
       The payments made to subcontractors are subject to similar
       price fluctuation indices as apply to the CONPVA message.
