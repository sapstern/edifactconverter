0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Announcement
       for returns message (RETANN) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message by which a party announces to another party details
       of goods for return due to specified reasons (e.g. returns for
       repair, returns at end of leasing period, returns because of
       damage).

1.2    Field of application

       The Announcement for returns message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       This message may be used by the message sender to request
       credit for goods, or the replacement of goods from the message
       recipient.
       
       This message should stimulate the message recipient to instruct
       on how the named goods should be returned, destroyed, or
       disposed of.
       
       In the case where the recipient of the announcement refuses to
       accept the return of goods the sender would expect to receive
       notification of this decision and also instructions on what
       should happen instead of the return. This process will usually
       be handled using the Instruction for Return message.
       
       The announcement for returns can be used by a party to inform
       another party on the requested return of:
       
       -    goods received in bad condition;
       -    goods received but not ordered;
       -    goods for repair;
       -    goods which have to be returned due to the end of a
       leasing contract;
       -    goods which have exceeded their expiry date without being
       sold;
       -    goods on commission;
       -    goods from sale on approval;
       -    sale or return goods;
       -    returnable transport or packaging containers;
       -    obsolete goods.
       
       The announcement for returns may be used to return received
       goods for which receipt of delivery may already have been
       acknowledged by way of the Receiving Advice message (where this
       message is being used), e.g., the faulty goods are only
       discovered on opening a container for which a receiving advice
       has been issued.
       
       The announcement for returns may also be used to specify
       additional information regarding the return of goods such as
       handling instructions or hazardous material information.
       
       The recipient of the announcement for returns is requested to
       decide the final disposition of the goods for return:
       
       -    whether the goods shall be returned, repaired, destroyed,
       or disposed of;
       -    which transport means and mode should be used;
       -    on or by which date the return should take place;
       -    which party is responsible for the cost of return.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment
       table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating
       requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole
       message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and
       implementation of the message:
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format 'ccyymmdd'
       /'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction agree
       that there is a functional requirement for an alternative
       format. Periods should be specified as whole numbers
       representing the required period as indicated in the format
       qualifier (weeks, months, etc.)
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not
       be included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent
       segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the
       trigger segment of a group.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as
       this inhibits automatic processing. It is only used when
       additional information that cannot be accommodated within the
       other segments is required.
