0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Product
       exchange reconciliation message (PRODEX) to be used in
       Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners
       involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

       This paper provides the definition of the United Nations
       Standard Product Exchange Message to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners.

1.1    Functional definition

       The Product Exchange Message is a communication between two
       trading partners with agreements for the loan of products to
       each other, to provide information about movements of products
       from and to various locations on particular dates.
       
       The message gives additional information on the outstanding
       balances of each product between the trading partners.
       
       No financial value is attached to the products and settlement
       is usually carried out between like products.

1.2    Field of application

       The Product exchange reconciliation message may be used for
       both national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       Each product exchange is covered by a bilateral contract and
       exchange accounts are balanced at agreed period ends.
       
       Each contract will define the units in which the product (or
       group of products) should be measured. This is known as The
       Unit of Account.
       
       A transaction forms the basis on which Product Exchanges are
       reconciled. A Transaction is defined as: a change of product
       title supported by the required data set for Delivery
       note/Ticket; or subsequently agreed Adjustments, Rebrands or
       Transfers.
       
       There may be many transactions within an accounting period.
       
       The product exchanged is identified by its product name, supply
       location, mode of transport, and date.

3.1    Standard terms and definitions

       See UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General
       Introduction, Section 2.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment
       table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating
       requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole
       message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and
       implementation of the message:
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format
       'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the
       transaction agree that there is a functional requirement for an
       alternative format. Periods should be specified as whole
       numbers representing the required period as indicated in the
       format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.)
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
       
       Due to the high volume of data that will be usually transmitted
       in the Product Exchange Reconciliation message, it is highly
       recommended to use codes for products and locations.
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not
       be included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent
       segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the
       trigger segment of a group.
