0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Establishment
       of contract message (CONEST) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       Upon completion of the tendering process, there is a
       requirement for the client or his representative to formally
       establish and issue the contractual Bill of Quantities. This
       documentation becomes the contractual basis for all future work
       and payment for the project.

1.2    Field of application

       The Establishment of contract message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.
       
       The following descriptions refer to the construction industry
       as an example, but do not exclude other business sectors'
       implementation.

1.3    Principles

       A BoQ is a set of documentation that describes the various
       facets of work that make up a construction project. This
       documentation is often quite voluminous and typically contains
       information structured in accordance with several industry
       standards.
       
       This documentation, or parts of it, is frequently exchanged
       between the parties involved in the project.
       
       A project is typically subdivided into individual groupings of
       work and within these groups are detailed work items. It is at
       the level of these detailed items that progress and payments
       are evaluated. 
       
       During the life of a project numerous amendments to the
       original contractual BoQ will be made. This CONEST message will
       be used to establish all such approved amendments.
       
       The post tender exchange of contractual information occurs many
       times in the life cycle of a project, thus there is a role for
       this CONEST message throughout the duration of a project.
       
       The initial exchange takes place at the point the two principal
       parties in the project, the Client and the Main Contractor,
       agree a contract. At this point the entire BoQ will be issued
       by the Client's representative to the Main Contractor. This
       will replace any previous versions of BoQ's used during the
       tendering process.
       
       Further BoQ exchanges continue from the Client's representative
       to the Main Contractor as the project progress. These
       subsequent exchanges reflect the evaluation of the project and
       are used to amend the original contractual documentation with
       changes approved by both parties.
       
       The other major area of use for this message standard is during
       the exchange between the Main Contractor and those companies
       that have contracts to undertake subcontracted work within the
       project. The procedures are similar to those described above,
       as they too are establishing and maintaining contractual
       details, this time for subdivisions of the overall project with
       the Main Contractor as the "Client".
       
       This is only one of a number of messages being designed for the
       BoQ and the principles for this CONEST message are consistent
       with those adopted for each of the BoQ messages.
       
       There are several concepts to be understood and these are key
       to some of the design principles adopted. Most of these have
       been created to respond to two base problems associated with
       the BoQ documentation: 
       
       i) A BoQ is often a very large document, it is not unusual for
       it to run to several volumes in its paper form.
       
       ii) Given the size of the document, there is also the problem
       of how to advise on the structure to which the document
       conforms and the accurate indexing and sequencing of
       information within such a volume of data.
       
       1.3.1 Work Items 
       
       Each individual component of work referred to in the BoQ is
       called a "work item" and it is at this level that progress and
       payments are evaluated.
       
       For each work item a description is provided and this
       description is very precise in its wording. This results in two
       things: 
       
       i) A lot of repetitive descriptions for like items at least at
       the higher levels within these levelled descriptions.
       
       ii) A lot of similar work items, indeed the same description,
       often occurs a number of times throughout the project but
       assigned to different work items. 
       
       Point ii) above has been addressed by a concept called
       "standard items", this enables an equivalent to standard
       library of descriptions to be exchanged and individual work
       items to reference a standard description that need be sent,
       only once.
       
       Frequently within a BoQ, elements of an item's description are
       common to adjacent items. When this happens the items which
       share the same description are grouped together and the common
       part of the description is presented once at the start of the
       group. This concept is used extensively and it is possible to
       have quite a number of layers of shared heading.
       
       Two distinctions need to be established: firstly, the existence
       of Heading text which is related to an item. There can be
       multiples of these as in the levels of a standard description.
       The second distinction is that of "Groups". Where a group is a
       collection of more than one work item and all of these items
       have a common theme.
       For example: 
       
       - they all belong to the same trade 
       - all for the same part of the project, building or structure.
       
       Despite the large number of items that they may embrace, or the
       fact that they represent substantial parts of the project, all
       of these are recognised as "groups".
       
       Thus, there can be several or many items within a group and
       there can be layers of groups within groups, all of which
       collectively constitute the project.
       
       1.3.2 Indexing 
       
       There are numerous variations for structuring the information
       that makes up the BoQ. Although, it is possible to introduce
       some standardisation it is clear that any message must allow
       the freedom to structure the data according to the dictates of
       a individual project. The design therefore, includes the
       ability to convey the document's structure as part of the BoQ
       message. Indeed the design allows for a different set of
       document structuring information, to be defined at group level
       as well as globally for the project. This means that a set of
       indexing rules can be defined to apply to the entire project
       and that a different set of indexing rules can be used to
       override these for a given group(s).
       
       To complement the indexing concept there is a component
       referred to as the "Project Index Reference". This is a faceted
       code assigned to all items of data that are to be used in
       conjunction with the index. In other words, all pieces of data
       that are to be structured using the index must contain a
       structured code composed in accordance with the index, and this
       is used as a "sorting" mechanism to ensure that the data is
       correctly structured.
       
       1.3.3 Message format 
       
       The actual appearance of the message bears no relation to the
       appearance of the current paper document.
       
       As there are unlimited permutations for assembling the BoQ data
       it has not been possible, nor desirable to make the appearance
       similar. The CONEST appearance is similar to the results of the
       data analysis exercise. Namely that there are 4 blocks or
       groupings of data, each of which can appear many times and that
       all of the mechanisms for linking and relating the components
       together are data elements within these blocks. The task of
       interpreting the indexing rules and subsequently assembling the
       data in the message will fall to local software.
       
       This approach has several advantages over the existing rigidity
       of the paper document. It is clear to the message design team
       that BoQ documentation exchanged using EDI will deliver a
       variety of new opportunities to its users.
       
       This last principle offers the solution to the volume problem
       too. One message has a definitive number of occurrences for
       each block of data. If for a "large" project this number is
       exceeded then multiple versions of the same message are built.
       It also enables a BoQ to be exchanged in subdivisions if so
       desired.
