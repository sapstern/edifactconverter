General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Tax control
       message (TAXCON) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration,
       commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A Tax control message is used to enable the transmission of
       summary and control data for tax purposes. It is used to
       summarise and control the taxes (e.g. VAT) or duty which
       applies to a batch or batches of related messages.

1.2    Field of application

       The Tax control message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The message meets control needs imposed by administrations and
       can be used by individual users for their own control purposes.
       
       The summary and control information is sent by the sender of
       tax related messages so the recipient may:
       
       a) verify the integrity of the transmission, i.e. of the tax
       related messages sent.
       
       b) maintain an archive of summary and control data of the tax
       related messages for audit purposes.
