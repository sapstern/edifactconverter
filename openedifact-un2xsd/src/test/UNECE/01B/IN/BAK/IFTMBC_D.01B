0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Booking
       confirmation message (IFTMBC) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

       This paper provides the definition of the Booking Confirmation
       Message to be used in fulfilling the requirements of trading
       partners in the  transport chain worldwide, in the interchange
       of cargo and transport related information using Electronic
       Data Interchange (EDI).
       
       This message is a single consignment based message, being
       aligned with other single consignment based messages such as
       the other two booking messages (IFTMBP and IFTMBF), the
       instruction messages (IFTMIN and IFTMCS) and the Arrival Notice
       Message (IFTMAN).
       The single consignment based messages can be used by all modes
       of transport for the forwarding and transport of goods from any
       origin to any destination, regardless of route or prevailing
       commercial practice.
       These messages are suitable for the arrangement of the
       transport of goods between all parties to the movement of the
       consignment (including the consignor/shipper and consignee as
       well as the forwarders, brokers, and carriers involved) as well
       as providing the information necessary to perform that
       transport and delivery of the goods.
       They should be used in the same way by each mode of transport
       when the requirements are common even if functionally similar
       information is known by different names.

1.1    Functional definition

       A message from the party providing forwarding and/or transport
       services to the party booking those services giving the
       confirmation information to the booking of the consignment
       concerned. A confirmation might read that the booking of a
       consignment is accepted, pending, conditionally accepted or
       rejected.
       
       The conditions under which requested services take place may be
       given in this message.
       
       This message can also be used between vessel operators, vessel
       sharing partners and cargo receiving and handling facilities
       such as marine terminals, inland receiving depots, rail ramps
       and truck terminals to confirm cargo particulars and equipment
       requirements of the transport provider to the service provider
       responsible for dispatching empty equipment and receiving the
       cargo.

1.2    Field of application

       The Booking confirmation message may be used for both national
       and international applications. It is based on universal
       practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and
       is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The message can be used whenever a confirmation of the booking
       of a consignment is deemed necessary as an answer to a booking
       provisional or booking firm message concerning a certain
       consignment. It can also be used to confirm cargo particulars
       and equipment requirements.
       
       The use of a Booking Confirmation Message is not compulsory.
       
       - A consignment may contain several goods items.
       
       - Goods items may or may not be containerized.
       
       - A goods item may be transported in one or more containers,
       and a single container may contain one or more goods items.
       
       - One goods item may be related to one or more customs tariff
       codes.
       
       - Goods items related to one customs tariff code may be carried
       in one or more containers.
       
       - Goods items may reflect either the contractual or operational
       description of the goods.
       
       - A party to the movement of the consignment may book or order
       transport for one or more goods items.
       
       - A party to the movement of the consignment may book or issue
       instructions of transport to be arranged for several goods
       items by means of one or several of the following messages:
       IFTMBP, IFTMBF, IFTMBC, IFTMIN, IFTMCS, IFTMAN.
       
       - Pre-carriage (advanced haulage) and/or on-carriage
       (destination haulage) of goods items or equipment within one
       booking or instruction may take place in different steps, each
       step specified with its own transport details group.
       
       - Equipment may have other types of equipment attached to it,
       e.g. a temperature control unit attached to a container.
       
       - Equipment and/or goods items may be attached to or
       transported on another load or transport device, which as such
       may be attached to or transported on yet another load or
       transport device, e.g. a container on a chassis on a rail-car.
       
       - Transport devices, which have the ability of powered movement
       on their own, are specified in the transport details group.
       Other load or transport devices are specified as equipment.
       
       - The expression of packaging for goods items can be expressed
       at up to three levels.
       
       The transport sub-working group (D4) has developed
       recommendations for a harmonised implementation of this message
       through its subgroup ITIGG (International Transport
       Implementation Guidelines Group).
       Users implementing the message are strongly advised to apply
       these recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4
       secretariat.
