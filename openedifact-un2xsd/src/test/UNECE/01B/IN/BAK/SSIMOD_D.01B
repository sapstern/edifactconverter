General Introduction
----------------------------------------------------------------------



0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Modification
       of identity details message (SSIMOD) to be used in Electronic
       Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The SSIMOD message is sent to communicate to the country of
       first registration the modification of identity details which
       took place since the last transmission related to the worker.

1.2    Field of application

       The Modification of identity details message may be used for
       both national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       The institution processing the modification of data related to
       a worker who was previously registered in another country
       (using the SSREGW message) sends the SSIMOD message to the
       country of first registration to notify these modifications.
       
       In this message, the data transmitted are :
       
       - the data used to identify a worker, 
       - the old value of the data to be modified 
       - the new value of these data.
