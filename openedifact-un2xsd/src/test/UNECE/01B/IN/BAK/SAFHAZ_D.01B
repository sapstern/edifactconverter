General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Safety and
       hazard data message (SAFHAZ) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The Safety and hazard data message is to enable the
       communication of safety data and advice on relevant materials
       supplied to industrial customers so as to enable them to take
       measures to protect their employees and the environment from
       any potential harmful effects from these materials.

1.2    Field of application

       The Safety and hazard data message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       The Safety data message has been designed to meet the
       requirements of both: the ISO recommendations and the EC
       Directive on Safety Data Requirements.
       
       The message incorporates all North American requirements as
       defined in the current ANSI transaction set.
       
       The message has been specifically designed to enable
       structured, semi-structured and unstructured data to be
       specified and transmitted.
       
       All future changes to the message must be checked against the
       various regional and national statutory requirements before the
       new version is published.
       
       A Safety data message relates to one dangerous or hazardous
       substance.
       
       A Safety data message is issued by the supplier of dangerous or
       hazardous substances.
       
       New or amended information about dangerous or hazardous
       substances must be quickly provided to every industrial
       recipient who has been supplied within a proscribed timescale.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment
       table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating
       requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole
       message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and
       implementation of the message:
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format 'ccyymmdd' or
       'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction agree
       that there is a functional requirement for an alternative
       format. Periods should be specified as whole numbers
       representing the required period as indicated in the format
       qualifier (weeks, months, etc.)
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not
       be included. Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in
       dependent segments does not conflict with the segment qualifier
       of the trigger segment of the group.
