0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Business
       credit report message (BUSCRD) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The Business credit report message is used by credit reporting
       agencies to provide business credit information about a company
       to the agency's trading partners. Business credit information
       includes, but is not limited to, company name(s) or
       location(s), financial, operational, legal and business credit
       rating information
       
       BUSCRD relates solely to the exchange of corporate or company
       credit information and is intended to enable the automation of
       business decision processing.

1.2    Field of application

       The Business credit report message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       BUSCRD is bi-directional. It can be used by buyers, sellers,
       marketeers, and financial institutions to request from a party
       holding such information, all or part of the credit information
       of an existing or potential trading partner. It can also be
       used by parties holding credit information to respond to
       requests, with all or part of the information as may be
       available in a data base. Upon receipt, the information can be
       used to support automated business decision processing and to
       update business data bases. BUSCRD may also be used to cancel
       previously transmitted information
       
       A single occurrence of BUSCRD may be used to request or to send
       information for one or more entities or to cancel one or more
       previous transmissions. The message beginning segment is used
       to indicate the specific message functionality.
       
       Cross referencing is permitted within the message to identify a
       related electronic exchange. There is typically no requirement
       to directly link external objects (e.g., associated data) to a
       business credit report. Stored data will normally be
       transmitted within the confines of the message structure.
       
       Changes to previously submitted data are considered as updates
       or replacements to the original data. The BUSCRD message
       structure does not provide for the identification of
       incremental changes. The receiving application should update
       the existing data with the revised or new data. If business
       practice requires retention of an auditable track of all data,
       then the receiving application should recognize the new data as
       a complete replacement, providing the necessary distinguishing
       criteria.
       
       While the BUSCRD message is independent of system applications,
       its structure derives from the manner in which credit
       information is developed and stored in data bases. Typically,
       credit information can be classified by category and type.
       BUSCRD structure is sufficiently flexible to accommodate
       industry and sectorial differences in data structures.
       
       The trigger segment of the group defining the hierarchy is used
       as the mechanism for accommodating differences in data content
       and data structure among users. Augmented functionality is
       attributed to this trigger segment permitting the
       identification of data dependencies and the content of
       hierarchically related segment groups. The continuation of
       parent and/or child relationships is permitted at all necessary
       levels as is the identification of the level to which the
       hierarchy applies. This permits the transmission of
       hierarchical information to as many differing levels as may be
       necessary to report credit information, the relationship of
       credit history data, and the relationships among business
       entities such as parent, subsidiaries affiliates and similar
       entities.
       
       Information conveyed within a BUSCRD message may be considered
       as business sensitive data. Notwithstanding, there are no
       special security requirements incorporated in the message
       structure. Security issues should be treated as matters to be
       resolved among trading partners and will likely involve varying
       solutions.
       
       BUSCRD may be used to provide information about a company, its
       branches, subsidiaries, affiliates, or parent company. Names,
       addresses, work experiences, business or professional titles of
       management within a company may be included. Other names (e.g.,
       previous) and length of time a business has been operational
       may be reported. History of a company may include its previous
       locations, original starting details, and legal changes.
       
       Operational data about a company may be included. This
       information may consist of detailed descriptions of activities.
       Such as buying and selling patterns. It may also include
       buildings or other facilities used, whether owned or rented,
       number of employees, and/or monetary or quantity amounts of
       products produced, sold or held in inventory.
       
       Financial information could be the largest part of a Business
       credit report message. This may include typical balance sheet
       information of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
       Outstanding debt such as loans or debentures may be reported as
       well as repayment history. Required governmental, financial
       statement information, its format periodicity and completeness
       may be sent. Financial institution account information may be
       stated with information pertaining to types of accounts and
       average balance in each account. A comparison to industry norms
       may be included.
       
       Payment information forms another large part of the BUSCRD
       message. This may include history of payments to suppliers and
       vendors. Breakdowns of payment amounts to specific payees.
       Payments made within contract terms, and past due or slow
       payments. A history of invoice payment terms to specific payees
       may be included along with discount percent and discount days
       due granted. A payment score indication promptness of payments
       over a period of time may be included.
       
       Public filings and legal actions may be reported although this
       varies among countries. Included may be any type of legal
       actions citing plaintiffs, defendants, attorneys, dates,
       status, legal damages and awards.
       
       An overall credit or risk assessment rating based upon the
       credit reporting agency's detailed analysis may be assigned. A
       detailed analysis of risk factors and credit or financial
       worthiness may be included.
