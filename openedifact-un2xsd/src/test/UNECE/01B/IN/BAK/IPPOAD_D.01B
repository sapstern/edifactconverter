0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Insurance
       policy administration message (IPPOAD) to be used in Electronic
       Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The Insurance policy administration message is exchanged
       between insurers, insurance intermediaries, clients and third
       parties for the purpose of policy administration. It covers the
       administration of a policy from initial placing, through
       adjustment and renewal to cancellation as well as providing
       policy declarations to third parties.

1.2    Field of application

       The Insurance policy administration message may be used for
       both national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       The message should contain information relating to a single
       insurance contract (which may be a single policy or a group of
       policies under one contract number), although this contract may
       have more than one insurer (co-insurance).
       
       The message may contain many business transactions but all must
       relate to a single contract.
       
       The message is used for all transaction types in either
       dialogue (request for and provision of policy details) or
       notification (after the event) processing.
       
       The structure of IPPOAD is based upon the insurance sub-working
       group insurance underwriting data model. The major entities in
       the data model form the core segment groups. These groups are
       for the policy contract (triggered by the Insurance cover
       description segment), parties (triggered by the Party name
       segment), insurance objects (triggered by the Risk object
       description segment), and events and activities (triggered by
       the Event segment) and are positioned at the top level in the
       message structure.
       
       When processing a policy transaction a series of input
       'components' associated with the major entities are processed.
       For example, when the insurance object is a premises then
       information on its construction is required, when the object is
       a vehicle then information on its security devices is required.
       As a result of the transaction a series of output 'components'
       is derived, for example, covers and premiums. These input and
       output components are carried in a group of segments triggered
       by component details, where a coded qualifier identifies the
       type of component. The component details component group is
       positioned hierarchically below each of the major entity groups
       in the message.
       
       Below each of the component groups a group of segments,
       triggered by premium calculation component, is positioned. The
       premium calculation component groups provide details of the
       components used to calculate the premiums and derive the covers
       for the main entities, for example, loadings, discounts,
       excesses, endorsements, conditions.
       
       Other top level groups that complete the message structure are
       triggered by the sequence details segment - to provide details
       of the insurance history (previous policies) for the risk and
       the payment terms segment - to provide payment details.
       
       Although the major entities are linked hierarchically to their
       input and output components and the premium calculation
       components there is also a requirement to link the entities
       relationally across the message structure, for example, parties
       (drivers) to objects (vehicles). To achieve the links each
       group has an Identity segment positioned as the first segment
       inside the group that contains a unique identification number.
       These identification numbers may then appear inside other
       groups as 'foreign keys' to provide the relational links. They
       may also be used to provide 'parent child' relationships; for
       example, a parent object of a premises may contain a child
       object of a freezer.
