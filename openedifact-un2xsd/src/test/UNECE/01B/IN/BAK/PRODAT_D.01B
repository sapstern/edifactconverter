0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Product data
       message (PRODAT) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration,
       commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message to submit master data - a set of data that is rarely
       changed - to identify and describe products a supplier offers
       to his (potential) customer or buyer. This information of long
       validity includes technical and functional product description
       but not commercial terms and conditions. This message can be
       used as well to update the information on a previously sent
       PRODAT message.

1.2    Field of application

       The Product data message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       This message provides product identification and description on
       the full or partial range of deliverable goods a supplier
       offers to his customers. It might be offered to a single
       customer, a multitude of customers and to agents as well.
       
       The information enables customers to select goods according to
       appropriate needs. To achieve this the subsequent details may
       be provided on specified goods:
       
       + products characteristics
       + technical data
       + utilisation description
       + utilisation requirements
       + handling information
       
       The information may be provided either structured or in free
       format.
       
       This message provides capability to identify technical
       information being mandatory for ordering.
       Descriptive and, or identifying parts of this message can be
       copied into orders as required.

       Introduction, Section 2.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment
       table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating
       requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole
       message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and
       implementation of the message:
       
       All specified dates and/or times should be in the format
       'ccyymmdd' or 'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the
       transaction agree that there is a functional requirement for an
       alternative format.
       
       Periods should be specified as whole numbers representing the
       required period as indicated in the date or time or period
       format (weeks, months, etc.).
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not
       be included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent
       segments does not conflict with the segment qualifier of the
       trigger segment of the group.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as
       this inhibits automatic processing.
