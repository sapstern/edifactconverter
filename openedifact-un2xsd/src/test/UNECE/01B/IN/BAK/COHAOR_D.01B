0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Container
       special handling order message (COHAOR) to be used in
       Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners
       involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       Order to perform a specified special handling and/or service on
       containers.
       
       This message is part of a total set of container-related
       messages. These messages serve to facilitate the intermodal
       handling of containers by streamlining the information
       exchange. 
       The business scenario for the container messages is clarified
       in a separate document, called: 'Guide to the scenario of
       EDIFACT container messages'.

1.2    Field of application

       The Container special handling order message may be used for
       both national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       Business area:
       Pre- and on-carriage transport of containers/equipment
       
       Sending functions include:
       Shipping agent, Logistic center, Freight forwarder
       
       Receiving functions include:
       Container terminal, Container depot, Inland terminal, Container
       freight station
       
       In the context of the 'Guide to the scenario of EDIFACT
       container messages' (as referred to at the start of section 1)
       the following guidelines, rules and functionality apply to this
       Container special handling order message:
       
       *   The message contents can be uniquely identified by a
       combination of the following data elements:
       - message sender (NAD)
       - ordering customer (NAD)
       - work order reference (RFF)
       
       *   A combination of the following data elements can be used in
       order to relate to business data contained in other container-
       related messages: container prefix and number (EQD)
       
       *   In one message special handling orders for several
       containers can be specified.
       
       *   The ultimate execution date and time of the special
       handling order can be included.
       
       *   For each container the sea-going vessel, sea voyage number
       can be given.
       
       *   The special handling orders are to be coded, completed with
       comments, if any.
       
       The transport sub-working group (D4) has developed
       recommendations for a harmonised implementation of this message
       through its subgroup ITIGG (International Transport
       Implementation Guidelines Group).
       Users implementing the message are strongly advised to apply
       these recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4
       secretariat.
