0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Purchase
       order change request message (ORDCHG) to be used in Electronic
       Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message from the buyer to the seller, specifying details of
       the buyer's request to change a purchase order.

1.2    Field of application

       The Purchase order change request message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       A buyer may request to change, or eventually cancel one or more
       goods items or services.
       
       A purchase order change request may refer to goods items or
       services related to one or more delivery schedules, call-offs,
       etc.
       
       A purchase order change request for cross-border transactions
       may contain additional information for customs and/or
       statistical purposes.
       
       A purchase order change request may contain details for
       transport and destination as well as delivery patterns.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment
       table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating
       requirements.
       
       For guidance, the following principles serve to remove
       ambiguity in the application of an EDI Purchase Order Change.
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format
       'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the
       transaction agree that there is a functional requirement for an
       alternative format. Periods should be specified as whole
       numbers representing the required period as indicated in the
       format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.).
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not
       be included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent
       segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the
       trigger segment of a group.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as
       this inhibits automatic processing.

4.1.1  Header section


       Information to be provided in the Header section:

0010   UNH, Message header
       A service segment starting and uniquely identifying a message.
       The message type code for the Purchase order change request
       message is ORDCHG.

       Note: Purchase order change request messages conforming to this
       document must contain the following data in segment UNH,
       composite S009:

       Data element  0065 ORDCHG
                     0052 D
                     0054 01B
                     0051 UN

0020   BGM, Beginning of message
       A segment by which the sender must uniquely identify the order
       change by means of its number and when necessary its function.
       
       If an Order is to be cancelled, use of Message Function Code
       (D/E: 1225) '1' indicates that the transmitted message requests
       a complete cancellation of a referenced Purchase Order. All
       data is to be cancelled.
       
       If an Order is to be changed, use of Message function code '4'
       indicates that the transmitted message requests specified
       changes of the referred Purchase Order.
       
       If an Order is to be replaced, use of Message Function Code '5'
       indicates that the transmitted message effects a complete
       replacement of the referenced Purchase Order. All data are to
       be replaced in their entirety by that in the current message.
       
       If an Order response with changes is to be confirmed, use of
       Message Function Code '6' indicates the confirmation by the
       buyer of amendments proposed by the seller.
       
       If an Order is to be duplicated, use of Message Function Code
       '7' indicates that the transmitted message is an exact
       duplication of a previous Purchase Order Change Request.
       
       If an order is to be cancelled and to be re-issued, use of
       Message Function Code '17' indicates that the transmitted
       message effects a complete cancellation of the referenced
       Purchase Order, and that a Purchase Order will be issued.
       
       If only the heading section of an order is to be replaced, use
       of Message Function Code '20' indicates that the transmitted
       message effects changes in Heading Section data only. The
       complete Heading Section data is transmitted to replace all
       data previously sent. Detail and Summary Section data remain
       unchanged.
       
       If only item detail and summary is to be replaced, use of
       Message Function Code '21' indicates that the transmitted
       message effects changes in Detail Section data, and may affect
       Summary data. Heading Section data remains unchanged.
       
       To indicate the last and final release of an order, use Message
       Function Code '22'.
       
       If an order is to be placed on hold, use of Message Function
       Code '23' indicates that the processing against the referenced
       purchase order has been suspended until further release
       information. An order placed on hold is subsequently released
       by Message Function Code 'XX'.
       
       If an Order is to be accepted without amendment, use of Message
       Function Code '29' indicates that the buyer accepts the
       reference message without amendments.
       
       If an order is to be Changed in detail section, use of Message
       Function Code '36' indicates that the transmitted message
       requests specified changes in data in the Detail section.
       Changes are indicated at the line item level.

0030   DTM, Date/time/period
       A segment specifying general dates and, when relevant, times
       related to the whole order or order change message. The segment
       must be specified at least once to identify the order change
       date.
       
       Examples of the use of this DTM segment are: Lead times that
       apply to the whole of the order and, if no schedule is to be
       specified, the delivery date.
       
       The Date/time/period segment within other Segment group should
       be used whenever the date/time/period requires to be logically
       related to another specified data item. e.g. schedule dates are
       specified within Segment group 50.

0040   PAI, Payment instructions
       A segment changing conditions of payment, guarantee and method
       of payment for the whole order. An example of the use of this
       segment is to specify that a documentary credit will be used.

       process this segment manually.

       all line items.
