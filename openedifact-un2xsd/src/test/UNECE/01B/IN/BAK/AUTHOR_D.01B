0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Authorization
       message (AUTHOR) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration,
       commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       An Authorization Message is sent by the Ordering Customer (or
       Payor or Agent on behalf of the Ordering Customer) or by a
       third party having authority on the Ordering Customer's
       payments to the Ordered Bank, to authorize the Ordered Bank to
       execute a given financial transaction.
       
       This financial transaction might relate to both multiple
       messages like PAYMUL and DIRDEB, and single instruction
       messages like PAYORD and PAYEXT.
       
       An Authorization Message could also be sent from the Ordered
       Bank to the Ordering Customer or its Authorization Authority to
       request authorization for a given financial transaction.
       
       Throughout this document the term 'Original Message' refers to
       the message to be authorized.

1.2    Field of application

       The Authorization message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       - The authorization carried by the message applies to the whole
       original message (i.e. to all instructions within the message)
       or to individual debit transactions and their related credits.
       
       -  The AUTHOR message may also authorize a single transaction
       in a multiple direct debit transaction.

3.     TERMS AND DEFINITIONS

3.1    Standard terms and definitions

       See UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General
       Introduction, Section 2.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment
       table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating
       requirements.
       
       The following semantic principles applying to the message are
       intended to facilitate the understanding of the message.
       
       The Authorization message is structured in three levels: A, B,
       and C.
       
       Level A Segment Groups 1, 2, 3 and 9 contains general data
       related to the whole message.
       
       Level B Segment Groups 4 and 5 contains data identifying the
       message or transaction to be authorized.
       
       Level C Segment Groups 6 to 8 contains the authorization.
       
       The structure of the message is designed to allow several B
       levels, each B level being followed by its related C levels.
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
