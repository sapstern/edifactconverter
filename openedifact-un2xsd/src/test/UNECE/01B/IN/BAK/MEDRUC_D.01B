General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Medical
       resource usage and cost message (MEDRUC) to be used in
       Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners
       involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The MEDRUC message is sent from a party providing medical and
       related administrative services to a funding institution,
       allowing evaluation of the medical activity and justification
       for reimbursement. It can also be sent from a funding
       institution to another party in order to advise which
       reimbursements have been made.
       
       The MEDRUC message can carry either initial specifications of
       used resources and costs, or modifications to specifications
       given in a previous message.
       
       Typically, the MEDRUC message can be used between a healthcare
       service provider or an insurance company and another insurance
       company as well as between an insurance company and a
       healthcare service provider.

1.2    Field of application

       The Medical resource usage and cost message may be used for
       both national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.
       
       Particularly, MEDRUC can be applied for all types of healthcare
       service providers, funding institutions and healthcare systems.

1.3    Principles

       The MEDRUC message has a hierarchical structure:
       - One message can carry one or more reimbursement claims.
       - Each reimbursement claim concerns medical services provided
       to one or several patients.
       - Each medical service gives information about service provided
       including amounts and price information (unit, prices,
       quantities, rates) as well as medical justification for the
       services provided (clinical information concerning diseases or
       interventions) and administrative justification for services
       provided according to insurance coverage.
       - Each medical service can consist of none, one or many
       detailed medical activities.
       - Each detailed medical activity can contain the same
       information elements as for a medical service.
       
       Additional information can be attached to each level of the
       hierarchical structure using an internal reference mechanism.
       This information may include:
       - medical, administrative and financial parties involved.
       - relevant insurance contracts and corresponding rights.
       - description of patient or healthcare service provider
       transportation.
