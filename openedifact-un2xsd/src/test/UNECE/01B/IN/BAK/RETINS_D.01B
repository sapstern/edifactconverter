0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Instruction
       for returns message (RETINS) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message by which a party informs another party whether and
       how goods shall be returned.

1.2    Field of application

       The Instruction for returns message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       The sender of an instruction for returns message will normally
       have previously been informed by the recipient of the intention
       to return goods by means of the Announcement for Returns
       message.
       
       The instruction for returns message can be used to inform the
       receiving party on:
       
       - whether the goods shall be returned, repaired, destroyed, or
       disposed of;
       
       - which transport means and mode shall be used;
       
       - on or by which date the return shall take place;
       
       - which party is responsible for initialising transportation;
       
       - which party is responsible for the transportation costs;
       
       - any additional costs related to the return;
       
       - the carrier who shall carry out the transportation;
       
       - the address to which the returned goods should be sent;
       
       - any associated documents which will be raised in conjunction
       with the instruction for return, e.g. credit note.
       
       - fixed returns instructions for items which are returned on a
       scheduled basis, e.g. the collection of unsold newspapers will
       take place at a fixed time each week.
       
       The instruction for returns may also be used to specify
       additional information regarding the return of goods such as
       handling instructions or hazardous material information.
       
       The instruction for returns may be used to inform a party if
       the sender refuses, or does not require, return of the goods.
       It must in this case indicate what action the message recipient
       should carry out (e.g. disposal, destroy).

       Introduction, Section 2.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment
       table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating
       requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole
       message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and
       implementation of the message:
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format 'ccyymmdd' /
       'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction agree
       that there is a functional requirement for an alternative
       format. Periods should be specified as whole numbers
       representing the required period as indicated in the format
       qualifier (weeks, months, etc.).
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not
       be included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent
       segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the
       trigger segment of a group.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as
       this inhibits automatic processing. It is only used when
       additional information that cannot be accommodated within the
       other segments is required.
