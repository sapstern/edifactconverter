General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Notification
       of registration of a worker message (SSREGW) to be used in
       Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners
       involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The SSREGW message is exchanged between designated bodies to
       enable interchange and registration of a worker's social
       security number. The message is also exchanged by designated
       bodies to request and compile details of worker's social
       security insurance record.

1.2    Field of application

       The Notification of registration of a worker message may be
       used for both national and international applications. It is
       based on universal practice related to administration, commerce
       and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       The SSREGW message is used for several purposes :
       
       1 - it is sent by the designated body of one State to the
       equivalent body of another State to advise that a national of
       the latter State has registered for Social Security purposes in
       the former State and to advise the Social Security number
       allocated to him.
       
       2 - it is sent by the designated body which received a SSREGW
       message of the former type to acknowledge receipt of this
       message and to advise or confirm the registration number of the
       worker.
       
       3 - it is sent by the designated body of one State to the
       equivalent body of another State to request details of a
       worker's Social Security insurance record in the latter State.
       
       4 - it is sent by the designated body in the State of the
       worker's nationality to equivalent bodies in all other States
       in which the worker has been registered to communicate
       insurance numbers in other states.
