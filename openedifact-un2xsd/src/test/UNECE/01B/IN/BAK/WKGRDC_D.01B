0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Work grant
       decision message (WKGRDC) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message specifying details of decisions of the governmental
       agency to an employer relating to a work grant request or
       permit for one or more workers.

1.2    Field of application

       The Work grant decision message may be used for both national
       and international applications. It is based on universal
       practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and
       is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The intention of the message is to provide detailed information
       and decisions of the governmental agency relating to a previous
       single work grant request message.
       
       A Work Grant Decision Message is transmitted from the
       governmental agency to an employer.
       
       A Work Grant Decision Message contains detailed information
       about the worker, the detail of the decision, the acceptance or
       the rejection and the reasons for the decision in case of a
       rejection. A Work Grant Decision Message may contain the full
       textual information of the decision.
       
       A Work Grant Decision Message also contains information of the
       profession and the place of work.
       
       A Work Grant Decision Message may also contain information and
       decisions relating to work grant requests for one or more
       workers.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment
       table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating
       requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole
       message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and
       implementation of the message:
       
       All specified dates and times should be in the format 'yymmdd'
       or 'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction agree
       that there is a functional requirement for an alternative
       format. Periods should be specified as whole numbers
       representing the required period as indicated in the format
       qualifier (weeks, months, etc.)
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not
       be included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent
       segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the
       trigger segment of a group.
