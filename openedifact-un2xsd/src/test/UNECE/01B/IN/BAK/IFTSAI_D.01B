0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Forwarding
       and transport schedule and availability information message
       (IFTSAI) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The function of this message is to request transport schedule
       or availability information and to answer to such a request.

1.2    Field of application

       The Forwarding and transport schedule and availability
       information message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       This message may be used:
       
       a) to request operating means of transportation for a specific
       routing. Certain specific research criteria such as date/time
       of operation and type of transport desired may be precised to
       limit the volume of information requested.
       
       b) to answer to such a request furnishing a list of operating
       means of transport in accordance with the selection criteria.
       Such answer may comprise direct and/or combinations of means of
       transport.
       
       c) to request means of transport on which space is available
       for a specific routing. Certain specific research criteria like
       date/time of operation, type of transport and space desired may
       be precised to limit the volume of information requested.
       
       d) to answer to such request furnishing a list of available
       means of transport in accordance with the selection criteria.
       Such an answer may comprise direct and/or combinations of means
       of transport.
       
       The transport sub-working group (D4) has developed
       recommendations for a harmonised implementation of this message
       through its subgroup ITIGG (International Transport
       Implementation Guidelines Group).
       Users implementing the message are strongly advised to apply
       these recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4
       secretariat.
