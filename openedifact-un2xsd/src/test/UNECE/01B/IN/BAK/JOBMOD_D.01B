0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Job order
       modification message (JOBMOD) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message specifying modifications of a previously sent Job
       Order Message of one or more offered jobs or vacancies in an
       enterprise or organization. The Job Order Modification Message
       is transmitted from an employer or employment agency to an
       employment office. The information and the changes detailed in
       the message are related to profession, experiences, salaries,
       education, work and contract conditions.

1.2    Field of application

       The Job order modification message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       The intention of the message is to provide modifications and
       detailed information for one or more jobs or vacancies offered
       by an employer. A Job Order Modification Message is transmitted
       from an employer or employment agency to an employment agency.
       A Job Order Modification Message may contain detailed
       information about the requirements of an applicant for the job,
       e.g. age, sex, occupation or occupation type, location of the
       job, education, knowledge, experiences. A Job Order
       Modification Message may also contain detailed information of
       the remuneration offered, a job application and/or arrangements
       for an interview.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment
       table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating
       requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole
       message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and
       implementation of the message: 
       All specified dates and times should be in the format 'yymmdd'
       or 'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction agree
       that there is a functional requirement for an alternative
       format. 
       Periods should be specified as whole numbers representing the
       required period as indicated in the format qualifier (weeks,
       months, etc.) Where a choice of code or text is given only the
       code element should be used wherever possible. 
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not
       be included. 
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent
       segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the
       trigger segment of a group.

4.1.1  Header section


       Information to be provided in the Header section:

0010   UNH, Message header
       A service segment starting and uniquely identifying a message.
       The message type code for the Job order modification message is
       JOBMOD.

       Note: Job order modification messages conforming to this
       document must contain the following data in segment UNH,
       composite S009:

       Data element  0065 JOBMOD
                     0052 D
                     0054 01B
                     0051 UN

0020   BGM, Beginning of message

0030   DTM, Date/time/period
       A segment specifying general dates and, when relevant, times
       related to the whole message. The segment must be specified at

          should be specified, e.g. where the enterprise and the job
          administration are known to each other, thus only the coded
          identification is required, but a job center or a job
