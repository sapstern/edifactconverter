0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Waste
       disposal information message (WASDIS) to be used in Electronic
       Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message to convey information on last inspection and on waste
       on board of a means of transport (e.g. vessel) and/or equipment
       related to a means of transport - and still to be disposed in
       the next place or port of call of the means of transport.

1.2    Field of application

       The Waste disposal information message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       The message has been designed to enable control of pollution
       caused by a means of transport, e.g. in the maritime and port
       environment. 
       
       * The message relates to one means of transport and/or
       equipment related to a means of transport. 
       
       * The message is issued only after the departure of the means
       of transport. 
       
       * The message is issued only in the event that an inspection of
       the means of transport has taken place. 
       
       Business area: control of pollution by a means of transport
       (e.g. maritime pollution) 
       
       Sending function: authority (e.g. port), centralised database
       of authorities 
       
       Receiving function: authority (e.g. port) in the next place or
       port of call of the means of transport (e.g. vessel), search
       and rescue organisation.
