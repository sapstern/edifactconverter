General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Container
       stuffing/stripping order message (COSTOR) to be used in
       Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners
       involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       Order that specified goods/consignments are to be stuffed into
       (already or still to be delivered) or stripped from LCL-
       containers.
       This message is part of a total set of container-related
       messages.
       These messages serve to facilitate the intermodal handling of
       containers by streamlining the information exchange.
       The business scenario for the container messages is clarified
       in a separate document, called: 'Guide to the scenario of
       EDIFACT container messages'.

1.2    Field of application

       The Container stuffing/stripping order message may be used for
       both national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       Business area:
       Pre- and on-carriage transport of containers/equipment
       
       Sending functions include:
       Shipping agent, Logistic center
       
       Receiving functions include:
       Container freight station
       
       
       In the context of the 'Guide to the scenario of EDIFACT
       container messages' (as referred to at the start of section 1)
       the following guidelines, rules and functionality apply to this
       Container stuffing/stripping order message:
       
       *   The message contents can be uniquely identified by a
       combination of the following data elements:
       - carrier agent, coded (NAD)
       - carrier, coded (TDT)
       - stuffing/stripping order reference number (RFF)
       
       *   One shipping line, one seagoing vessel, one sea voyage
       number and one shipping agent can be specified on message top
       level.
       
       *   An indicator for the transport status (i.e., export,
       import, transhipment or continental) can be completed on
       container level (EQD-segment).
       
       *   One message may contain several containers identified by
       their prefix and number or several equipment guidelines for
       groups of (empty) containers.
       
       *   If the container prefix and number is unknown, a
       supplementary container reference number (e.g. Container
       sequence number) can be used to identify a container group in
       the message to be able to refer to this information of the
       container(s) in e.g. the Container stuffing/stripping report
       message (COSTCO).
       
       *   Guidelines can be specified in the message in order to load
       (empty) containers that cannot be identified by their full
       prefix and serial numbers.
       In case of a guideline a combination of size and type and/or a
       certain range of equipment serial numbers (container prefix and
       numbers) can be given for a group of one or several containers.
       
       *   Inland transport details can be specified for each
       individual container or can be specified on message top level
       (for all containers in the message); the two options must not
       be used simultaneously.
       
       *   An inland transport charges reference or a sea booking
       reference can be specified either on message top level (related
       to all containers in the message) or for each individual
       container; the two options must not be used simultaneously.
       
       *   For each container details can be specified such as
       container prefix and number, size and/or type, loading
       instructions, special instructions, and non-standard
       dimensions.
       
       *   In case of export the port of discharge and a port of
       transhipment can be specified for each individual container.
       
       *   An LCL (Less than Full Container Load) goods item may be
       detailed, such as number and type of packages, goods
       description, gross weight, dangerous goods information and
       special instructions.
       
       *   Goods item information can be related to the corresponding
       containers by linking the goods item group (GID) to the
       container details group(s) (EQD) by means of the SGP-segment.
       
       *   The ultimate date/time of stuffing/stripping can be given
       for each individual LCL-container.
       
       *   Each LCL-consignment can be identified by means of a
       booking reference and the original shipper, and may consist of
       several LCL goods items.
       
       * The address to which the empty container(s) are to be
       returned after stripping can be included, together with
       corresponding reference number(s) on message level.
       
       The transport sub-working group (D4) has developed
       recommendations for a harmonised implementation of this message
       through its subgroup ITIGG (International Transport
       Implementation Guidelines Group).
       Users implementing the message are strongly advised to apply
       these recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4
       secretariat.
