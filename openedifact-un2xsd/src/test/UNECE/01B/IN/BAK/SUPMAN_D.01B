General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the
       Superannuation maintenance message (SUPMAN) to be used in
       Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners
       involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The Superannuation Maintenance Message is sent by a party to an
       organisation administering a superannuation scheme, to specify
       membership maintenance information about superannuation scheme
       members.

1.2    Field of application

       The Superannuation maintenance message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       - A Superannuation Maintenance Message gives information about
       updates or reviews of superannuation scheme member details for
       retirement benefit purposes.
       
       - The message may be used to provide information about a single
       member as well as multiple members employed by the same
       employer.
       
       - The message structure is generalised by specifying several
       conditional segments and segment groups. Only a subset of the
       conditional segments may be needed to meet particular
       requirements. If necessary, specific subsets may be associated
       with the document/message name identification in the BGM
       segment or with other provided identifiers. Users intending to
       use the message should study the conditional segments and
       segment groups to decide which are necessary for their
       application.
       
       - A Superannuation Maintenance Message may be sent by an
       employer, on behalf of an employer or any other authorised
       party.
       
       - A Superannuation Maintenance Message is based on agreements
       between the parties.
