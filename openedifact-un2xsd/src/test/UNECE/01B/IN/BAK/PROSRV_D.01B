0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Product
       service message (PROSRV) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message providing the information and details to enable
       servicing and repair centres to report to manufacturers on
       repairs and other services carried out on products and
       appliances. The message provides details for claims under
       guaranty or contract to be reimbursed.
       
       The information transmitted gives details of the claimant,
       manufacturer and seller. It may give details of the purchaser
       of the product. It can identify the product and specify the
       date it was purchased and delivered, can specify the problem
       and describe the labour, parts used and costs incurred in the
       repair of the product. The message may also be used by the
       manufacturer or his agent to respond to the claimant.

1.2    Field of application

       The Product service message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The PROSRV message can be used to report on multiple claims, or
       may be used in respect of a single claim.
       
       The message will contain information relevant to whether the
       claim is covered by warranty or not.
       
       The repair or service centre will indicate the details of any
       repairs undertaken.
       
       The details of the repairs may include symptoms and defect
       identification codes, parts replaced or repaired, charges for
       labour, material, transport and other charges incurred during
       the repair or service of the product.
       
       Each claim will refer to one product. There may be multiple
       faults with the product and multiple parts used in the repair
       of the product.
       
       The details of the ultimate customer, the seller and the time
       and place of purchase may be given per product being repaired.

       Introduction, Section 2.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment
       table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating
       requirements.
       
       The following guidelines apply to the whole message and are
       intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation of
       the message:
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format
       'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the
       transaction agree that there is a functional requirement for an
       alternative format. Periods should be specified as whole
       numbers representing the required period as indicated in the
       format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.)
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given, the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not
       be included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent
       segments does not conflict with the segment qualifier of the
       trigger segment of a group.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as
       this inhibits automatic processing.

          where possible only the coded form of the party
