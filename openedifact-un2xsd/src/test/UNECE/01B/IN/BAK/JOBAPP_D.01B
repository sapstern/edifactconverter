0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Job
       application proposal message (JOBAPP) to be used in Electronic
       Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message specifying detailed information of proposals for one
       or more job applicants from an employment agency to an
       employer. The detailed information is related to profession,
       occupation, age, education, experiences, salaries, other
       benefits, requested location of the job, work and contract
       conditions.

1.2    Field of application

       The Job application proposal message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       The intention of the message is to provide information of
       proposals for one or more job applicants. A Job Application
       Proposal Message is transmitted from an employment agency to an
       employer or an employment agency. A Job Application Proposal
       Message may contain detailed information, in form of
       advertisements, of one or more applicants. A Job Application
       Proposal Message may be related to earlier offered jobs or
       vacancies by an employer.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment
       table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating
       requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole
       message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and
       implementation of the message:
       All specified dates and times should be in the format 'yymmdd'
       or 'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction agree
       that there is a functional requirement for an alternative
       format.
       Periods should be specified as whole numbers representing the
       required period as indicated in the format qualifier (weeks,
       months, etc.).
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not
       be included.
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent
       segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the
       trigger segment of a group.

       Information to be provided in the Header section:
