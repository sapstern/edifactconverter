0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Multiple
       interbank funds transfer message (FINPAY) to be used in
       Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners
       involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A Multiple interbank funds transfer message is sent between
       financial institutions to request the transfer of funds in
       settlement of the referenced business transaction(s).
       
       The FINPAY message may be exchanged directly between financial
       institutions or through a clearing system.
       
       Depending on the account relationship between the financial
       institutions, the FINPAY may be used as a payment order and/or
       as a credit advice.
       
       The FINPAY may also be used for collections, documentary
       credits, direct debits and other financial institution related
       transfers.

1.2    Field of application

       The Multiple interbank funds transfer message may be used for
       both national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       - A Multiple interbank funds transfer message may cover several
       funds transfer instructions.
       
       - However, one FINPAY message must cover either credit
       transfers or debit transfers, i.e., these two functions must
       not be mixed in the same message.
       
       - The only way to modify a Multiple interbank funds transfer
       message is to cancel the whole message or part thereof (e.g.,
       by using the FINCAN - Financial Cancellation message). In that
       respect, one to many transaction(s) could be cancelled within
       the message, avoiding the need to cancel the whole message.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment
       table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating
       requirements.
       
       The following semantic principles applying to the message are
       intended to facilitate the understanding of the message:
       
       The Multiple interbank funds transfer message is structured in
       three levels: A, B, and C.
       
       - Level A contains general data related to the whole message
       and is contained in Segment Groups 1, 2, 31 and 32.
       
       - Level B contains information needed to effect the funds
       transfer, such as the total amount to be transferred, the value
       date, the currency, the charges allocation, and data which
       applies to all the dependent C levels and is contained in
       Segment Group 3 through Segment Group 11.
       
       - Level C contains data specific to the individual transactions
       and may contain remittance information. This data is considered
       as unique for each transaction and is contained in Segment
       Group 12 through Segment Group 30.
       
       The structure of the message is designed to allow several B
       levels, each B level being followed by its related C levels.
