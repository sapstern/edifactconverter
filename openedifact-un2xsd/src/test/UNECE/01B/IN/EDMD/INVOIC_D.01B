0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Invoice
       message (INVOIC) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration,
       commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message claiming payment for goods or services supplied under
       conditions agreed between the seller and the buyer.
       
       The United Nations Standard Invoice Message, with correct data
       qualification, serves also as the specification for Debit Note
       and Credit Note messages. Throughout this document, the
       reference to 'Invoice' may be interpreted as conveying the
       wider meaning of 'Invoice/Credit Note/Debit Note'.

1.2    Field of application

       The Invoice message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       - A seller may invoice for one or more transactions
       
       - An invoice may refer to goods, items or services related to
       one or more orders, delivery instructions, call-offs, etc.
       
       - An invoice may contain references to payment terms 
       
       - An invoice for cross border transactions may contain
       additional information for customs and/or statistical
       purposes/services
       
       - An invoice may contain transport details.

3.1    Standard terms and definitions

       See UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General
       Introduction, Section 2.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment
       table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating
       requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole
       message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and
       implementation of the message: 
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format
       'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the
       transaction agree that there is a functional requirement for an
       alternative format. Periods should be specified as whole
       numbers representing the required period as indicated in the
       format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.) 
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not
       be included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent
       segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the
       trigger segment of a group.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as
       this inhibits automatic processing.
