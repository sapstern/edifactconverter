0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Invoice message
       (INVOIC) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between
       trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message claiming payment for goods or services supplied under
       conditions agreed between the seller and the buyer.
       
       The United Nations Standard Invoice Message, with correct data
       qualification, serves also as the specification for Debit Note and
       Credit Note messages. Throughout this document, the reference to
       'Invoice' may be interpreted as conveying the wider meaning of
       'Invoice/Credit Note/Debit Note'.

1.2    Field of application

       The Invoice message may be used for both national and international
       applications. It is based on universal practice related to
       administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the
       type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       - A seller may invoice for one or more transactions
       
       - An invoice may refer to goods, items or services related to one or
       more orders, delivery instructions, call-offs, etc.
       
       - An invoice may contain references to payment terms 
       
       - An invoice for cross border transactions may contain additional
       information for customs and/or statistical purposes/services
       
       - An invoice may contain transport details.

2.     REFERENCES

       Section 1.

3.     TERMS AND DEFINITIONS

3.1    Standard terms and definitions

       See UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction,
       Section 2.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message
       and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation
       of the message: 
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format 'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm'
       unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that there is a
       functional requirement for an alternative format. Periods should be
       specified as whole numbers representing the required period as
       indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.) 
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element should
       be used wherever possible.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not be
       included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments
       do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment of
       a group.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as this
       inhibits automatic processing.

4.1.1  Header section


       Information to be provided in the Header section:

0010   UNH, Message header
       A service segment starting and uniquely identifying a message. The
       message type code for the Invoice message is INVOIC.

       A segment specifying general dates and, when relevant, times related
       to the whole message. The segment must be specified at least once to
       identify the invoice date. Examples of the use of this DTM segment
       is: "shipped on date" or "delivery date".
       
       The Date/time/period segment within other Segment groups should be
       used whenever the date/time/period requires to be logically related

       within the PYT Segment group.

          the coded form of the party ID should be specified e.g. The Buyer
          and Seller are known to each other, thus only the coded ID is
          required, but the Consignee or Delivery address may vary and
