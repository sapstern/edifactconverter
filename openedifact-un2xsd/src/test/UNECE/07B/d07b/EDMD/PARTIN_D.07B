0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Party
       information message (PARTIN) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message to enable the transmission of basic information
       regarding locations and the related operational,
       administrative, financial, manufacturing, confirmation of
       registration and trading data.

1.2    Field of application

       The Party information message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The accurate and unambiguous identification of the trading
       partners and their operational parameters is an essential issue
       for EDI.
       
       The Party Information Message serves to maintain the partners
       master data files.
       
       Note: Once the data available in master data files is
       established: 
       - identifying codes should be used instead of clear data 
       - clear data is to be used if it is required to override the
       data from a particular transaction.
       
       The Party Information Message is used to specify information
       related to physical locations and to functional locations. A
       functional location is usually a specific department within a
       company.
       
       The change, delete, add indicator being given in the BGM
       segment, one separate message has to be provided per type of
       function required.

3.1    Standard terms and definitions

       See UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General
       Introduction, Section 2.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment
       table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating
       requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole
       message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and
       implementation of the message: 
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format
       'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the
       transaction agree that there is a functional requirement for an
       alternative format. Periods should be specified as whole
       numbers representing the required period as indicated in the
       format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.) 
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not
       be included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent
       segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the
       trigger segment of a group.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as
       this inhibits automatic processing.

4.1.1  Header section


       Information to be provided in the Header section:

0010   UNH, Message header
       A service segment starting and uniquely identifying a message.
       The message type code for the Party information message is
       PARTIN.

       Note: Party information messages conforming to this document
       must contain the following data in segment UNH, composite S009:

       Data element  0065 PARTIN
                     0052 D
                     0054 07B
                     0051 UN

0020   BGM, Beginning of message
       A segment for unique identification of the Document name and
       number.
       The message function code (DE 1225) applies to all transactions
       indicated in the message. Consequently, one separate message
       has to be provided per type of function required.
       The following rules apply: 
       - Addition (DE 1225 = 2). This code is used for providing
       information about parties for the first time to the trading
       partner.
       - Deletion (DE 1225 = 3). This code is used to delete parties
       from the partner's master file; In case of deletion, only the
       NAD segments need to be sent in the detail section.
       - Change (DE 1225 = 4). This code is used to modify any
       information relevant to parties already known by the trading
       partner. All the segments relating to the party including the
       address to be modified need to be sent.
       - Confirmation (DE 1225 = 6). This code is used when party
       information is sent again for confirmation.

       accommodated within other segments. In computer to computer
       exchanges such text will normally require the receiver to
       process this segment manually.
