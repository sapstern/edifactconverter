0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Direct
       balance of payment declaration message (BOPDIR) to be used in
       Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners
       involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The Direct balance of payments declaration message (BOPDIR) can
       be sent by non-bank residents to report directly to the Balance
       of Payments (BOP) compiler on:
       * transactions via bank accounts held at a resident bank
       * transactions via bank accounts held at a non-resident bank
       * transactions and clearing via accounts with non-bank non-
       residents
       * foreign assets and liabilities
       * information in the context of a BOP-related survey (stock and
       flows); for those countries which base their compilation of the
       Balance of Payments on surveys.

1.2    Field of application

       The Direct balance of payment declaration message may be used
       for both national and international applications. It is based
       on universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       The message contains 2 parts:
       
       In the first part of the message, it is used to supply
       information on amounts received from non-residents via resident
       banks. This is an alternative route to sending a BOPINF message
       to the bank.
       
       In the second part, this message can also be used for reporting
       on settlements via external bank accounts, current accounts
       held abroad with non-banks or participation in an international
       clearing system.
       
       Further, this message part can also be used for reporting
       results for all types of BOP-related surveys: either for
       reporting results of general questionnaires or for specific
       questionnaires such as the reports on positions (foreign assets
       and liabilities).
       
       Each part is independent from each other. A message can contain
       either or both of them.
