0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Insurance
       claim solicitor's instruction message (ICSOLI) to be used in
       Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners
       involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The Insurance claim solicitor's instruction message is
       exchanged between insurers and solicitors acting on behalf of
       the insurer during claim dispute resolution. It allows the
       insurer to provide claim details and instructions and the
       solicitor to report progress and resolution details.

1.2    Field of application

       The Insurance claim solicitor's instruction message may be used
       for both national and international applications. It is based
       on universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       Each instance of the message contains information relating to
       one claim only.
       
       The message may be used to exchange information of a claim
       dispute irrespective of the type of resolution being applied
       e.g. court settlement, independent arbitration, negotiation
       etc.
       
       The message is used by insurers to provide policy and claim
       information to the solicitor and also to request a progress
       update.
       
       It is used by the solicitor to request information from an
       insurer as well as to provide progress and resolution details.
