0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Periodic
       customs declaration message (CUSPED) to be used in Electronic
       Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       This Periodic Customs Declaration Message (CUSPED) permits the
       transfer of data from a declarant to a customs administration
       for the purpose of meeting legislative and/or operational
       requirements in respect of the periodic declaration of goods
       for import or export. The message may also be used, for
       example :
       
       - to transmit consignment data from one customs administration
       to another;
       - to transmit data from a customs authority to other
       governments agencies and/or interested administrations;
       -  to transmit data from a declarant to the appropriate data
       collection agency on the movement of goods between statistical
       territories.

1.2    Field of application

       The Periodic customs declaration message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       This message incorporates the necessary complementary and/or
       aggregated data relating to transport, statistical and customs
       information of a given period.
       
       The design principles adopted allow for referencing one or
       more previous simplified Customs declarations pertaining
       to the same periodic declaration.
       A customs item consists of the grouping of document lines
       having the same customs characteristics (e.g. tariff
       number, declared use, etc.). The message correspondingly
       permits the use of single or multi-packaging concepts and
       their identification to a customs item.
