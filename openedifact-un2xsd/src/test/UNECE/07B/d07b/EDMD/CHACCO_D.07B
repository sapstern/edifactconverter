0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Chart of
       accounts message (CHACCO) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       This message deals with the communication of charts of accounts
       between an organization and whoever may use them for the
       purpose of accounting, auditing, cost accounting,
       consolidation, financial analysis, etc.

1.2    Field of application

       The Chart of accounts message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The chart of accounts may be set up by an enterprise, a service
       bureau, a chartered accountant or an auditor - referred to as
       sender - for appropriate parties - known as recipient - such
       another enterprise, another service bureau, another chartered
       accountant or another auditor. 
       
       The chart of accounts is a systematically organized list of
       accounts that is sufficiently detailed to allow the recording
       of operations affecting the financial conditions of an
       organization. The chart of accounts can be either in accordance
       with sector-based accounting standards, national or
       international, or those established by an organization. 
       
       The message CHACCO contains information about a set of accounts
       for a given period. The frequency of data collection ranges
       from daily to annually.
