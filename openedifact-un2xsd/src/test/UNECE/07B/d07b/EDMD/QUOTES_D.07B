0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Quote message
       (QUOTES) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message which provides potential sellers with the ability to
       provide price, delivery schedule, and other conditions for
       potential sales of goods or services.

1.2    Field of application

       The Quote message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       - A potential seller may offer one or more goods items or
       services.
       
       - A quotation may refer to goods items or services related to
       one or more delivery schedules, call-offs, etc.
       
       - A quotation for cross border transactions may contain
       additional information for customs and/or statistical purposes.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment
       table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating
       requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole
       message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and
       implementation of the message:
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format
       'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the
       transaction agree that there is a functional requirement for an
       alternative format. Periods should be specified as whole
       numbers representing the required period as indicated in the
       format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.)
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
       
       Data that is not necessary to meet the functional requirements
       of the message should not be included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent
       segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the
       trigger segment.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as
       this inhibits automatic processing.
