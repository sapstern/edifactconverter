0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Forwarding
       and transport shipment charge calculation message (IFTCCA) to
       be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading
       partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The function of this message is to request the calculation of
       the transport charges of a specific shipment and to answer to
       such a request.

1.2    Field of application

       The Forwarding and transport shipment charge calculation
       message may be used for both national and international
       applications. It is based on universal practice related to
       administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on
       the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       This message may be used:
       
       a) to request the charge calculation of a specific shipment at
       a specific date. Certain specific criteria such as type of rate
       desired, number of packages/units, weights or volumes and
       dimensions can be provided to facilitate such calculation.
       
       b) to answer to such a request furnishing the transport charges
       calculated in accordance with the calculation criteria
       provided.
       
       The transport sub-working group (D4) has developed
       recommendations for a harmonised implementation of this message
       through its subgroup ITIGG (International Transport
       Implementation Guidelines Group).
       Users implementing the message are strongly advised to apply
       these recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4
       secretariat.
