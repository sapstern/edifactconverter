General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Banking
       status message (BANSTA) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A BANSTA message is sent by a financial institution to its
       customer and/or vice versa and among financial institutions. It
       is used for all kind of enquiries, answers and status
       information at application level.

1.2    Field of application

       The Banking status message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       A BANSTA message must always refer to a specific previously-
       sent message.
       
       - A BANSTA message may cover the response given to any
       previously-sent message, such as a commercial or payment
       instruction, a request for information, etc. This message
       provides a means to report on errors and inconsistencies found
       in the original message at application level.
       
       - It is not intended to report on syntactical errors or to
       provide a non-repudiation response.
       
       - This message may provide status information about execution
       on original multi-instruction messages such as the Multiple
       Payment Order message (PAYMUL) or a multiple Direct Debit
       message in a positive and/or negative way.
       
       - This message does not apply to responses given to payment
       instructions, when another message type is necessary. This
       message could be used for any response to a previously-sent
       message when such response is needed and/or requested.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment
       table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating
       requirements.
       
       The following semantic principles apply to the message and are
       intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation of
       the message:
       
       The Banking Status message is structured in three levels: A, B
       and C.
       
       -   Level A Segment Groups 1, 2, 3 and 9 contains general data
       related to the whole message.
       
       -   Level B Segment Groups 4 and 5 refers to the previously-
       sent message and, if necessary, identifies a single transaction
       within a multiple message.
       
       -   Level C Segment Groups 6 to 8 provides the reason and
       details for the status of message/transaction.
       
       -   The structure of the message is designed to allow several B
       and C levels, each level B being followed by at least one or
       several C levels.
       
       -   Where a choice of code or text is given only the code
       element should be used wherever possible.
