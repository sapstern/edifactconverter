General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Terminal
       performance message (TPFREP) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The Terminal performance message is a message to transmit
       information relating to the operations carried out by terminal
       operators such as the loading, discharging and rehandling of
       containers and/or roll on/roll off items, hatch covers etc.

1.2    Field of application

       The Terminal performance message may be used for both national
       and international applications. It is based on universal
       practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and
       is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The Terminal performance message will be transmitted by a
       terminal operator to the ship operator, tonnage centre or
       shipping line. The message is used to give information on the
       operational handling of a ship in a container terminal after
       the completion of the operations.
