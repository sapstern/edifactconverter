0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Balance of
       payment customer transaction report message (BOPCUS) to be used
       in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners
       involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The Balance of payments customer transaction report message
       (BOPCUS) is sent by banks to the Balance of payments (BOP)
       compiler for reporting individual customer transactions (debit
       and credit) processed during a specific time period.

1.2    Field of application

       The Balance of payment customer transaction report message may
       be used for both national and international applications. It is
       based on universal practice related to administration, commerce
       and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       The structure of the BOPCUS message is related to the structure
       of the finance messages (PAYORD / PAYMUL / PAYEXT).
       
       The BOPCUS message can also be used to provide a copy of the
       relevant contents of a corresponding BOPINF or CREADV message.
