0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Justified
       payment request message (JUPREQ) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       This message may be sent by an accounts payable service or
       equivalent to a payment service or equivalent to request the
       payment of a sum to one or several creditors. The message may
       provide all the details required for auditability purposes to
       justify the requested payment sum(s) in order to enable the
       payment to be made automatically after the necessary automatic
       validation (i.e., to ensure that all required information is
       present and is correct).

1.2    Field of application

       The Justified payment request message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       A Justified payment request message is sent by an accounts
       payable service or equivalent to a payment service or
       equivalent in order to request that payment be made to one or
       several creditors.
       
       The message may also include a reference to all the documents
       (electronic and paper) which justify the sum being requested to
       be paid thus providing the possibility to trace back to
       specific documents and consequently identify the originator
       (electronic messages being signed electronically) and the level
       of debt engaged.
