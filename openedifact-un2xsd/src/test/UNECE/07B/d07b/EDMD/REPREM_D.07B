General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Reinsurance
       premium message (REPREM) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The Reinsurance Premium Message (REPREM) allows to support the
       technical entries for any premium or brokerage adjustment
       amount. For this purpose, it enables to render all the relevant
       data (mainly amounts and the way they are built up) used in the
       actual calculation of the adjustment, as well as the other
       relevant elements used in the specific formula.

1.2    Field of application

       The Reinsurance premium message may be used for both national
       and international applications. It is based on universal
       practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and
       is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       A reinsurance technical account (catered for in the RETACC
       message) is only acceptable by the receiver if certain figures
       are supported by specific calculations, in which the sender
       explains how he arrived at these figures. This message caters
       for 3 of these specific calculations, i.e. premium adjustment
       (flat or retrospective - considering the past loss history for
       the contract), reinstatement premium (which is an additional
       premium to be paid by the reinsured in order to reinstate the
       cover granted by the reinsurer) and brokerage adjustment
       (triggered by a premium adjustment).
