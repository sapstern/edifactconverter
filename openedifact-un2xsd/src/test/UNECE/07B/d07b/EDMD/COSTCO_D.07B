0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Container
       stuffing/stripping confirmation message (COSTCO) to be used in
       Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners
       involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       Confirmation that specified goods/consignments have been
       stuffed into or stripped from LCL-containers.
       This message is part of a total set of container-related
       messages.
       These messages serve to facilitate the intermodal handling of
       containers by streamlining the information exchange.
       The business scenario for the container messages is clarified
       in a separate document, called: 'Guide to the scenario of
       EDIFACT container messages'.

1.2    Field of application

       The Container stuffing/stripping confirmation message may be
       used for both national and international applications. It is
       based on universal practice related to administration, commerce
       and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       Business area:
       Pre- and on-carriage transport of containers/equipment
       
       Sending functions include:
       Container freight station
       
       Receiving functions include:
       Shipping agent, Logistic center
       
       
       In the context of the 'Guide to the scenario of EDIFACT
       container messages' (as referred to at the start of section 1)
       the following guidelines, rules and functionality apply to this
       Container stuffing/stripping confirmation message:
       
       *   The message contents can be uniquely identified by a
       combination of the following data elements:
       -  Carrier agent, coded (Shipping agent) (NAD)
       -  Carrier, coded (Shipping line) (TDT)
       -  Stuffing/stripping order reference number (RFF)
       
       *   One message may contain several containers.
       
       *   One shipping line and one shipping agent can be specified
       on message top level.
       
       *   The sea booking reference can be given for each individual
       LCL-consignment (Less than Full Container Load).
       
       *   For each container details can be specified such as
       container prefix and number, size and/or type, seals and off-
       dimensions details.
       
       *   Each LCL-consignment can be identified by means of a
       booking reference and the original shipper, and may consist of
       several LCL goods items.
       
       *   For each LCL goods item details can be specified, such as
       goods description, gross weight, volume, marks and numbers,
       number and kind of packages, any dangerous goods specifications
       and Customs and non-Customs documents.
       
       *   Goods item information can be related to the corresponding
       containers by linking the goods item group (GID) to the
       container details group(s) (EQD) by means of the SGP segment.
       
       The transport sub-working group (D4) has developed
       recommendations for a harmonised implementation of this message
       through its subgroup ITIGG (International Transport
       Implementation Guidelines Group).
       Users implementing the message are strongly advised to apply
       these recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4
       secretariat.
