0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the
       Superannuation contributions advice message (SUPCOT) to be used
       in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners
       involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The Superannuation Contributions Advice is sent by a party to
       an organisation administering a superannuation scheme, to
       detail contribution payments made for members of the
       superannuation scheme.

1.2    Field of application

       The Superannuation contributions advice message may be used for
       both national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       - a Superannuation Contributions Advice gives detailed
       information about a payment into a superannuation scheme for
       retirement benefit purposes.
       
       - the payment is generally on behalf of a number of members but
       could be for single member.
       
       - the payment may refer to multiple dates.
       
       - a Superannuation Contributions Advice is based on agreements
       between the parties.
       
       - contributions may be made by any party or on behalf of any
       party or parties; usually this means an employer and/or its
       employees.
