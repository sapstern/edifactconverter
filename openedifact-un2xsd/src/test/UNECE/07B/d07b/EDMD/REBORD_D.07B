General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Reinsurance
       bordereau message (REBORD) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A reinsurance bordereau message is made of individual policy
       data and their impact on a reinsurance contract. More
       specifically, the REBORD can be used to report how the
       reinsurance premiums or claims figures are built up, or to
       report individual cessions affecting a reinsurance contract.

1.2    Field of application

       The Reinsurance bordereau message may be used for both national
       and international applications. It is based on universal
       practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and
       is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       REBORD supplies the basic information required to identify and
       allocate individual claims, outstanding losses and premium
       figures that appear amalgamated in the technical account
       (RETACC) or other messages (REPREM, RECLAM).
