1.2    Field of application

       The Social administration message may be used for both national
       and international applications. It is based on universal
       practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and
       is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

       wages or advantages from an employer.
        - regarding a particular event concerning one or more
       employee(s).
