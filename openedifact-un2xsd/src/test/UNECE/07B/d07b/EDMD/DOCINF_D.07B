0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Documentary
       credit issuance information message (DOCINF) to be used in
       Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners
       involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The Documentary Credit Issuance Information message is used to
       indicate the terms and conditions of an issued documentary
       credit from the Issuing Bank to the Applicant and/or the
       Applicant's Bank.

1.2    Field of application

       The Documentary credit issuance information message may be used
       for both national and international applications. It is based
       on universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       Unless otherwise specified, the documentary credit is issued
       subject to the Uniform Customs and Practices for Documentary
       Credits, International Chamber of Commerce, Paris, France,
       which are in effect on the date of issue.

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment
       table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating

       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole

       -   Where a choice of code or text is given only the code
       element should be used whenever possible.

       requirements of the message should not be included.
