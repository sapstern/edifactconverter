0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Consignment
       advice message (IFTMCA) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

       This paper provides the definition of the Consignment Advice
       Message to be used in fulfilling the requirements of trading
       partners in the transport chain worldwide, in the interchange
       of cargo and transport related information using Electronic
       Data Interchange (EDI).
       This message is a single consignment based message, being
       aligned with other single consignment messages (IFTMBP, IFTMBF
       and IFTMBC), the Instruction Contract Status Message (IFTMCS)
       and the Arrival Notice Message (IFTMAN).
       The single consignment based messages can be used by all modes
       of transport for the forwarding and transport of goods from any
       origin to any destination, regardless of route or prevailing
       commercial practice.
       These messages are suitable for the arrangement of the
       transport of goods between all parties to the movement of the
       consignment (including the consignor/shipper and consignee as
       well as the forwarders, brokers, and carriers involved) as well
       as providing the information necessary to perform that
       transport and delivery of goods.
       They should be used in the same way by each mode of transport
       when the requirements are common even if functionally similar
       information is known by different names.

1.1    Functional definition

       A message conveying prior notification of a consignment
       delivery, including non-hazardous and hazardous consignment
       details, for subsequent shipment and/or consolidation, or
       conveying a consignment advice for insurance from the party
       issuing a transport instruction or from the party issuing a
       transport contract to the insurer and/or the insurance
       intermediary. The message can also be used to confirm evidence
       of insurance, issued by the insurer to the shipper, bank or
       other third party (insurance certificate or policy).

1.2    Field of application

       The Consignment advice message may be used for both national
       and international applications. It is based on universal
       practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and
       is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The consignment advice provides pre-notification of consignment
       delivery at a seaport, airport, railhead and
       consolidation/deconsolidation centres. The message may be used
       between consignors, consignor's agents and carriers to
       Receiving Authority and/or local agent.
       - A consignment may contain several goods items.
       - Goods items may or may not be containerized. 
       - A goods item may be transported in one or more containers,
       and a single container may contain one or more goods items.
       - One goods item may be related to one or more customs tariff
       codes.
       - Goods items related to one customs tariff code may be carried
       in one or more containers.
       - Goods items may reflect either the contractual or operational
       description of the goods.
       - A party to the movement of the consignment may book or order
       transport for one or more goods items.
       - Pre-carriage (advanced haulage) and/or on-carriage
       (destination haulage) of goods items or equipment within one
       booking or instruction may take place in different steps, each
       step specified with its own transport details group.
       - Equipment may have other types of equipment attached to it,
       e.g. a temperature control unit attached to a container.
       - Equipment and/or goods items may be attached to or
       transported on another load or transport device, which as such
       may be attached to or transported on yet another load or
       transport device, e.g. a container on a chassis on a rail-car.
       - Transport devices, which have the ability of powered movement
       on their own, are specified in the transport details group.
       Other load or transport devices are specified as equipment.
       - The expression of packaging for goods items can be expressed
       at up to three levels.
       For insurance purposes the message can be used either by the
       shipper to inform the insurer and/or insurance intermediary
       about a planned transport, or by the shipper or carrier to
       inform the insurer and/or the insurance intermediary about a
       consignment under contract (bill of lading).
       When used to convey Insurance Certificate or Insurance Policy
       details the insurer or the underwriting agent of the insurer
       can confirm evidence of insurance for a consignment to the
       shipper, bank or third party.
