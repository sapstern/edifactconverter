0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Instruction
       contract status message (IFTMCS) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

       This paper provides the definition of the Instruction Contract
       Status Message to be used in fulfilling the requirements of
       trading partners in the transport chain worldwide, in the
       interchange of cargo and transport related information using
       Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).
       
       This message is a single consignment based message, being
       aligned with other single consignment based messages such as
       the booking messages  (IFTMBP, IFTMBF and IFTMBC), the
       Instruction Message (IFTMIN) and the Arrival Notice Message
       (IFTMAN).
       The single consignment based messages can be used by all modes
       of transport for the forwarding and transport of goods from any
       origin to any destination, regardless of route or prevailing
       commercial practice.
       These messages are suitable for the arrangement of the
       transport of goods between all parties to the movement of the
       consignment (including the consignor/shipper and consignee as
       well as the forwarders, brokers, and carriers involved) as well
       as providing the information necessary to perform that
       transport and delivery of the goods.
       
       They should be used in the same way by each mode of transport
       when the requirements are common even if functionally similar
       information is known by different names.

1.1    Functional definition

       A message from the party providing the transport/forwarding
       services to the party that issued the instructions for those
       services stating the actual details, terms and conditions
       (charges when applicable) of the service and of the consignment
       involved. In addition it can be used for the exchange of
       contract information between carriers mutually.

1.2    Field of application

       The Instruction contract status message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       The party providing the transport services will send an
       instruction contract status message, usually after receipt of
       the instruction message. The message can replace the actual
       contractual document such as for instance a Waybill, under
       those circumstances where there are no legal or other
       restrictions.
       
       The message might contain information concerning charges but
       should not be seen as a replacement for the invoice.
       
       - A consignment may contain several goods items.
       
       - Goods items may or may not be containerized.
       
       - A goods item may be transported in one or more containers,
       and a single container may contain one or more goods items.
       
       - One goods item may be related to one or more customs tariff
       codes.
       
       - Goods items related to one customs tariff code may be carried
       in one or more containers.
       
       - Goods items may reflect either the contractual or operational
       description of the goods.
       
       - Pre-carriage (advanced haulage) and/or on-carriage
       (destination haulage) of goods items or equipment within one
       booking or instruction may take place in different steps, each
       step specified with its own transport details group.
       
       - Equipment may have other types of equipment attached to it,
       e.g. a temperature control unit attached to a container.
       
       - Equipment and/or goods items may be attached to or
       transported on another load or transport device, which as such
       may be attached to or transported on yet another load or
       transport device, e.g. a container on a chassis on a rail-car.
       
       - Transport devices, which have the ability of powered movement
       on their own, are specified in the transport details group.
       Other load or transport devices are specified as equipment.
       
       - The expression of packaging for goods items can be expressed
       at up to three levels.
       
       The transport sub-working group (D4) has developed
       recommendations for a harmonised implementation of this message
       through its subgroup ITIGG (International Transport
       Implementation Guidelines Group).
       Users implementing the message are strongly advised to apply
       these recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4
       secretariat.
