0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Cargo
       insurance claims message (IFTICL) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       This paper provides the definition of the Cargo insurance
       claims message to be used in fulfilling the requirements of
       trading partners in the transport chain world-wide, in the
       interchange of cargo and transport related information using
       Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).
       The message is for a single consignment and can be used by all
       modes of transport for the forwarding and transport of goods
       from any origin to any destination, regardless of route or
       prevailing commercial practice.
       This message is exchanged between transport industry
       participants, insurers, insurance intermediaries, surveyors and
       loss adjusters. The message conveys single consignment cargo
       insurance related information, such as details of one single
       loss, claim or survey and the parties involved.

1.2    Field of application

       The Cargo insurance claims message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       The message is designed to give enough information to enable
       the insurer and/or insurance intermediary to start and/or
       continue the claim agreement process. It is not designed for
       claim payment as there are other messages for this purpose.
       
       - The message conveys information about one single loss,
       damage, claim, or survey related to one single consignment. Its
       content could be based on information from the messages IFTMAN
       or IFTSTA.
       - A consignment may contain several goods items.
       - Goods items may or may not be containerised.
       - A goods item may be transported in one or more containers,
       and a single container may contain one or more goods items.
       - One goods item may be related to one or more customs tariff
       codes.
       - Goods items related to one customs tariff code may be carried
       in one or more containers.
       - Goods items may reflect either the contractual or operational
       description of the goods.
       - A party to the movement of the consignment may book or order
       transport for one or more goods items.
       - Pre-carriage (advanced haulage) and/or on-carriage
       (destination haulage) of goods items or equipment within one
       booking or instruction may take place in different steps, each
       step specified with its own transport details group.
       - Equipment may have other types of equipment attached to it,
       e.g. a temperature control unit attached to a container.
       - Equipment and/or goods items may be attached to or
       transported on another load or transport device, which as such
       may be attached to or transported on yet another load or
       transport device, e.g. a container on a chassis on a rail-car.
       - Transport devices, which have the ability of powered movement
       on their own, are specified in the transport details group.
       Other load or transport devices are specified as equipment.
       - The expression of packaging for goods items can be expressed
       at up to three levels.
