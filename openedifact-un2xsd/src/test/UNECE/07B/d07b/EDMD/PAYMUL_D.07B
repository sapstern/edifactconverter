0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Multiple
       payment order message (PAYMUL) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A Multiple Payment order is sent by the Ordering Customer (or
       Payor or Agent on behalf of the Ordering Customer) to the
       Ordered Bank, to instruct the Ordered Bank to debit an account
       it services for the Ordering Customer, and to arrange for the
       payment of specified amounts to several Beneficiaries (or
       Payees) in settlement of the referenced business
       transaction(s).
       
       Throughout this document, the term 'Ordering Customer' refers
       to either an Ordering Customer, or a Payor or Agent acting
       (sending) on behalf of the Ordering Customer; likewise the term
       'Beneficiary' refers to either a Beneficiary, or a Payee or
       Agent acting on behalf of the Beneficiary.

1.2    Field of application

       The Multiple payment order message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.
       
       This message may be applied for both national and international
       settlements.

1.3    Principles

       - A Multiple Payment Order may cover the financial settlement
       of one or more commercial trade transactions such as invoices
       credit notes, debit notes etc. It is not intended for use in
       securities trading.
       
       - Charges may be borne on account(s) different of the
       account(s) held by the Ordering Customer.
       
       - Several debit accounts, execution dates and currencies may be
       specified.
       
       - The Ordered Bank may need a confirmation/authorization (e.g.
       AUTHOR message) to be allowed to process the Multiple Payment
       Order message.
       
       - The only way to modify a Multiple Payment Order message is to
       cancel the whole message or part thereof (e.g. by the use of
       the FINCAN message). In that respect, one to many order(s)
       could be cancelled within the message, avoiding to be obliged
       to cancel the whole message.

3.     TERMS AND DEFINITIONS

3.1    Standard terms and definitions

       See UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General
       Introduction, Section 2.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment
       table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating
       requirements.
       
       The following semantic principles applying to the message are
       intended to facilitate the understanding of the message: 
       
       The Multiple Payment Order message is structured in three
       levels:
       
       A,B, and C. In the Branching Diagram, level A corresponds to
       page 1, level B corresponds to page 2, and level C corresponds
       to pages 
       3 and 4.
       
       -A level contains data related to the whole message and is
       contained in Segment Group 1 and Segment Group 2 and the
       Heading section.
       
       -B level contains data from the debit side (one debit account,
       one currency, one execution date) and data which applies to all
       further details of C level(s) and is contained in Segment Group
       3 through Segment Group 9.
       
       -C level contains mainly data related to the credit side, and
       this data is considered as unique for each payment transaction
       and is contained in Segment Group 10 through Segment Group 21.
       
       - The structure of the message is designed to allow several B
       levels, each B level being followed by its related C levels.
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
