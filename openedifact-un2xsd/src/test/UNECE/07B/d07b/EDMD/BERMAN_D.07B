0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Berth
       management message (BERMAN) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The Berth management message is a message from a carrier, its
       agent or means of transport to the authority responsible for
       port and waterway management, requesting a berth, giving
       details of the call, vessel, berth requirements and expected
       operations.

1.2    Field of application

       The Berth management message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       This message is meant to comply with requirements of
       authorities concerning the request for berthing services. The
       following guidelines, rules and functionality apply to this
       Berth management message:
       
       1- A message will contain information on only one means of
       transport/conveyance. The only exception will be the case of
       covering pre-announcement function.
       
       2- A ship call may require several berths.
       
       3- One berth may be the scenario of several operations.
       
       4- The message has to cater for the provision of sending
       updates (cancellation, replace, provisional, definitive) or new
       services request such as shifts and request for second berth.
       The message will cover the function of pre-announcement of
       vessels.
       
       The Transport SWG Working Group (D4) has developed
       recommendations for a harmonised implementation of this message
       through its subgroup ITIGG (International Transport
       Implementation Guidelines Group). Users implementing the
       message are strongly advised to apply these recommendations,
       which may be obtained from the D4 secretariat.
