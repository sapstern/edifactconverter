General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Medical
       prescription message (MEDPRE) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The MEDPRE message is sent from a prescriber (issuer) of
       prescriptions (healthcare professionals, i.e. physician,
       dentist, or veterinarian) to a dispensing agent (i.e. pharmacy)
       in order to allow the dispenser to deliver dispensed
       medicines(s) for the treatment of a subject of care (patient,
       patient group, animal or animal group).
       
       The MEDPRE message may also be sent via a relaying agent for
       storage until it is requested by a dispenser. Copies of the
       message may also be sent to parties entitled to receive a copy.
       
       The MEDPRE message can also be used as a request for a
       prescription from a dispensing agent to a prescriber.

1.2    Field of application

       The Medical prescription message may be used for both national
       and international applications. It is based on universal
       practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and
       is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       A Medical prescription is an order to a dispenser to prepare
       prescribed medicines for a patient or animal and either to send
       them to a specific address or to await collection at the
       pharmacy.
       
       The following principles apply:
       
       - A Medical prescription message is issued to one subject of
       care: one patient, a group of patients, an animal, a group of
       animals, or for use by the issuer himself.
       
       - A Medical prescription message contains one prescription set
       which contains one or more prescription items, each of these
       for one medicinal product and/or appliance.
       
       - The prescribed medicinal product(s) can be identified by
       registered name, industry code, or a generic drug name.
       
       - The prescription may also be used for non-prescription
       medicinal products and/or appliances and other material from
       the pharmacy according to national regulations and local rules.
       
       - A prescription may contain extemporaneously dispensed
       medicines identified by a recipe.
       
       - The individual prescription item may contain information
       concerning repeat dispensing.
       
       - The individual prescription item as well as a complete
       prescription set may contain information concerning payment
       guarantor and payment details.
       
       - The dispensed medicine(s) can be delivered to the party at
       the pharmacy or alternatively sent to a specific address. All
       prescription items in a prescription set have the same delivery
       information.
