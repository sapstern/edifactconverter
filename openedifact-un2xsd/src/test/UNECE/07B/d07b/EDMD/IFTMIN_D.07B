0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Instruction
       message (IFTMIN) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration,
       commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

       This paper provides the definition of the Instruction Message
       to be used in fulfilling the requirements of trading partners
       in the transport chain worldwide, in the interchange of cargo
       and transport related information using Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI).
       
       This message is a single consignment based message, being
       aligned with other single consignment based messages such as
       the booking messages  (IFTMBP, IFTMBF and IFTMBC), the
       Instruction Contract Status Message (IFTMCS) and the Arrival
       Notice Message (IFTMAN).
       The single consignment based messages can be used by all modes
       of transport for the forwarding and transport of goods from any
       origin to any destination, regardless of route or prevailing
       commercial practice.
       
       These messages are suitable for the arrangement of the
       transport of goods between all parties to the movement of the
       consignment (including the consignor/shipper and consignee as
       well as the forwarders, brokers, and carriers involved) as well
       as providing the information necessary to perform that
       transport and delivery of the goods.
       
       They should be used in the same way by each mode of transport
       when the requirements are common even if functionally similar
       information is known by different names.

1.1    Functional definition

       A message from the party issuing an instruction regarding
       forwarding/transport services for a consignment under
       conditions agreed, to the party arranging the forwarding and/or
       transport services.

1.2    Field of application

       The Instruction message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The instruction results in a transport contract for a
       consignment and is primarily meant for administrative purposes.
       It will be the message from shipper to carrier or forwarder
       containing the final details of  the consignment for which
       services are provided. The instruction message is the one and
       only message which results in the actual contract which can
       either be a document or an electronic contract.
       
       If only one message will suffice in an exchange between a
       shipper and a carrier/forwarder the instruction message should
       be the one as this message is the only message that results in
       a contract. The receiving party is to ascertain whether the
       Instruction message is preceded by a Booking Firm message, to
       be able to interpret the function as being an administrative
       message only or an administrative and operational message.
       
       - A consignment may contain several goods items.
       
       - Goods items may or may not be containerized.
       
       - A goods item may be transported in one or more containers,
       and a single container may contain one or more goods items.
       
       - One goods item may be related to one or more customs tariff
       codes.
       
       - Goods items related to one customs tariff code may be carried
       in one or more containers.
       
       - Goods items may reflect either the contractual or operational
       description of the goods.
       
       - A party to the movement of the consignment may book or order
       transport for one or more goods items.
       
       - A party to the movement of the consignment may book or issue
       instructions of transport to be arranged for several goods
       items by means of one or several of the following messages:
       IFTMBP, IFTMBF, IFTMBC, IFTMIN, IFTMCS, IFTMAN.
       
       - Pre-carriage (advanced haulage) and/or on-carriage
       (destination haulage) of goods items or equipment within one
       booking or instruction may take place in different steps, each
       step specified with its own transport details group.
       
       - Equipment may have other types of equipment attached to it,
       e.g. a temperature control unit attached to a container.
       
       - Equipment and/or goods items may be attached to or
       transported on another load or transport device, which as such
       may be attached to or transported on yet another load or
       transport device, e.g. a container on a chassis on a rail-car.
       
       - Transport devices, which have the ability of powered movement
       on their own, are specified in the transport details group.
       Other load or transport devices are specified as equipment.
       
       - The expression of packaging for goods items can be expressed
       at up to three levels.
       
       The transport sub-working group (D4) has developed
       recommendations for a harmonised implementation of this message
       through its subgroup ITIGG (International Transport
       Implementation Guidelines Group).
       Users implementing the message are strongly advised to apply
       these recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4
       secretariat.
