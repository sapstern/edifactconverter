0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Purchase
       order message (ORDERS) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       under conditions agreed between the seller and the buyer.

1.2    Field of application

       The Purchase order message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       - A buyer may order for one or more goods items or services.
       
       - A purchase order may refer to goods items or services related
       to one or more delivery schedules, call-offs, etc.
       
       - A purchase order for cross-border transactions may contain
       additional information for customs and/or statistical purposes.
       
       - A purchase order may contain details for transport and
       destination as well as delivery patterns.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment
       table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating
       requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole
       message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and
       implementation of the message: 
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format
       'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the
       transaction agree that there is a functional requirement for an
       alternative format. Periods should be specified as whole
       numbers representing the required period as indicated in the
       format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.) 
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not
       be included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent
       segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the
       trigger segment of a group.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as
       this inhibits automatic processing.

0010   UNH, Message header
       A service segment starting and uniquely identifying a message.

       A segment specifying general dates and, when relevant, times
       related to the whole message. The segment must be specified at

       Examples of the use of this DTM segment are: Lead times that
       apply to the whole of the Order and, if no schedule is to be
       specified, the delivery date.
       The Date/time/period segment within other Segment group should
       be used whenever the date/time/period requires to be logically

       is specified within the PYT Segment group.

0040   PAI, Payment instructions
       A segment requesting or confirming conditions of payment,
       guarantee and method of payment for the whole order. An example

          where possible only the coded form of the party ID should be
          specified e.g. The Buyer and Seller are known to each other,
          thus only the coded ID is required, but the Consignee or
