0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Price/sales
       catalogue message (PRICAT) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message to enable the transmission of information regarding
       pricing and catalogue details for goods and services offered by
       a seller to a buyer.
       The message can also be sent by a buyer to a seller. This may
       be a response (acceptance or rejection) to a previously
       received price/sales catalogue message, or a notification of
       negotiated prices.

1.2    Field of application

       The Price/sales catalogue message may be used for both national
       and international applications. It is based on universal
       practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and
       is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       - A Price/Sales Catalogue Message Pricing-group or item may
       refer to either goods items or services.
       
       - The Price items are structured together according to
       industrial or commercial requirements.
       
       - The sales and delivery conditions within a Price/Sales
       Catalogue Message may refer to:
       
       . all product/service items of the Price/Sales Catalogue
       Message,
       . a group of product/service items,
       . a single product/service item in the message,
       . within a single product/service item to different price basis
       occurrences.
       
       - A Price/Sales Catalogue Message may contain product and price
       information, as well as sales conditions.
       
       - The Price Item Line may identify the component parts of the
       price item.
       
       When using the price/sales catalogue message to provide a
       response, the message sender may specify this information in
       one of two ways:
       
       - The total acceptance or rejection of a previous price/sales
       catalogue message;
       
       - The rejection of information either at a product group level
       or at an individual product level.

       Introduction, Section 2.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment
       table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating
       requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole
       message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and
       implementation of the message:
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format
       'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the
       transaction agree that there is a functional requirement for an
       alternative format. Periods should be specified as whole
       numbers representing the required period as indicated in the
       date/time/period format (weeks, months, etc.).
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not
       be included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent
       segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the
       trigger segment of the group.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as
       this inhibits automatic processing.

       Note: Price/sales catalogue messages conforming to this
       document must contain the following data in segment UNH,
       composite S009:

       Data element  0065 PRICAT
                     0052 D

0030   DTM, Date/time/period
       A segment specifying general dates and, when relevant, times
       related to the whole message. The segment must be specified at
       least once to identify the Price/sales catalogue document date.
       
       Examples of the use of this DTM segment are: Lead times that
       apply to the whole Price/Sales catalogue or expiration
       date/time of the Price/sales catalogue.
       
       The Date/time/period segment within other Segment groups should
       be used whenever the date/time/period requires to be logically

          It is recommended that where possible only the coded form of
          the party ID should be specified, e.g. The sender and the
          receiver are known to each other, thus only the coded ID is

2370                  CCI, Characteristic/class id
                      A segment to identify product characteristic
                      and, or the characteristic name and
                      characteristic relevance for the business
                      process.

2380                  CAV, Characteristic value
                      A segment to specify product-characteristic by
                      value in either coded form or in free format.

2390                  MEA, Measurements
                      A segment indicating characteristic values being

                      quantities and percentages) related to specified
                      product characteristics (for example voltage,
                      percentage of material contained) and where
                      relevant measurement ranges. The MEA-segment is
                      repeatable to allow the indication of a number
                      of applicable measurable values, for example one
                      electric appliance may be switchable for
                      different voltages: 110V, 220V, 240V and 380V.
