0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Multiple
       debit advice message (DEBMUL) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A DEBMUL message is sent by an Account Servicing Financial
       Institution to the Account Owner or to a third party, which has
       agreed bilaterally in advance, that its account (s) has been or
       will be debited for specified amount (s) on the date (s)
       indicated, in settlement of the referenced business transaction
       (s).

1.2    Field of application

       The Multiple debit advice message may be used for both national
       and international applications. It is based on universal
       practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and
       is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       - A DEBMUL may cover the financial settlement of one or more
       commercial trade transactions, such as invoices, credit notes,
       debit notes, etc. It is not intended for use in securities
       trading.
       
       - Several debit accounts, value dates, entry dates and
       currencies may be specified.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment
       table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating
       requirements.
       
       The following semantic principles apply to the message and are
       intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation of
       the message:
       
       The Multiple Debit Advice message is structured in three
       levels: A, B and C.
       
       - Level A Segment Groups 1,2,3 and 28 contains general data
       related to the whole message.
       
       - Level B Segment groups 4 to 9 is based on the following
       rules:
         Level B contains data which applies to all the dependent C
       levels, such as,
       
         Same area Code:
       When the BUS segment is used, domestic and international items
       should not be mixed in the same sequence of B and C levels.
       
         Same currency and same account:
         The items to be grouped must refer to the same account. The
       currency to be booked must be the same as that of the account.
       
         Same value date:
         The items must have the same value date.
       
         Same entry date:
         The items must be booked on the same day.
       
         Same bank operation code:
         The items must bear the same bank operation code.
       
         Remark: If, for the same receiver, one of these 5 basic
       pieces of information changes, a new level B is required.
       
       - Level C Segment groups 10 to 27 contains the individual
       transactions, which are related to the data stored on level B.
       
       - The structure of the message is designed to allow several B
       and C levels, each level B being followed by one or several C
       levels.
       
       - Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
