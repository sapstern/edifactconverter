       message (DEBADV) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration,
       commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A Debit Advice is sent by the Account Servicing Financial
       Institution to the Account Owner to inform the Account Owner
       that its account has been or will be debited for a specified
       amount on the date indicated, in settlement of the referenced
       business transaction(s).

1.2    Field of application

       The Debit advice message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       A Debit Advice may cover the financial settlement of one or
       more commercial trade transactions, such as invoices, credit
       notes, debit notes, etc. It is not intended for use in
       securities trading.
