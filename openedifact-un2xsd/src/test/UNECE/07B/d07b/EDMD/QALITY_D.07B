0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Quality data
       message (QALITY) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration,
       commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message to enable the transmission of the results of tests
       performed to satisfy a specified product or process
       requirement. The content includes, but is not limited to, test
       data and measurements, statistical information, and the testing
       methods employed.

1.2    Field of application

       The Quality data message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       - A Quality Data Message detail line may refer to either goods
       items or services.
       
       - The values within a Quality Data Message may refer to: 
       
       . a product/service, 
       . a product via batch references,
       . process type information of a product.
       
       - A Quality Data Message may contain discrete or statistical
       values as well as product specification values.

       Introduction, Section 2.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment
       table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating
       requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole
       message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and
       implementation of the message:
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format
       'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the
       transaction agree that there is a functional requirement for an
       alternative format. Periods should be specified as whole
       numbers representing the required period as indicated in the
       format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.) 
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not
       be included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent
       segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the
       trigger segment of a group.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as
       this inhibits automatic processing.

          properties, the individual properties within that class and
          the related data (e.g. discrete values, statistical

             Measured attribute code (6313) or Characteristic
             description code (7037) must be present.
             
             If Class type code (7059) AND Measured attribute code

             the related STA/MEA-segments.
             
             The data element Characteristic description (7036) should
             only be used to enhance the meaning of the code value
             (e.g. if no specific code available and code value ZZ
             (mutually defined) is used then Description can be used
             to further describe the Product Characteristics.
             
             NB: The Class identification element in this segment is
             only used to specify the product characteristic class,
             e.g. Chemistry or Physical Dimensions.

             associated with a test resulting in discrete
             measurements. If used in this position, the values only
             apply to data within the same analysis group.

0510         SPS, Sampling parameters for summary statistics
             A segment to define the sampling parameters associated
             with summary statistics reported. If used in this
             position, the values only apply to data within the same
             analysis group.

0520         DTM, Date/time/period
             A segment specifying the date, and when relevant, the
             time of an activity identified by the date/time
             qualifier, e.g. date/time, test performed.

0530         FTX, Free text
