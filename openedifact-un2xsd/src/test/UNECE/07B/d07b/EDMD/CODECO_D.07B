0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Container
       gate-in/gate-out report message (CODECO) to be used in
       Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners
       involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message by which a terminal, depot, etc. confirms that the
       containers specified have been delivered or picked up by the
       inland carrier (road, rail or barge). This message can also be
       used to report internal terminal container movements (excluding
       loading and discharging the vessel) and to report the change in
       status of container(s) without those containers having
       physically been moved.
       
       This message is part of a total set of container-related
       messages. These messages serve to facilitate the intermodal
       handling of containers by streamlining the information
       exchange. The business scenario for the container messages is
       clarified in a separate document, called: 'Guide to the
       scenario of EDIFACT container messages'.

1.2    Field of application

       The Container gate-in/gate-out report message may be used for
       both national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       Business area:
       Pre- and on-carriage transport of containers/equipment.
       
       Sending functions include:
       Container depot, Inland terminal, Container freight station
       
       Receiving functions include:
       Shipping agent, Logistic center, Shipper (copy), Freight
       forwarder (copy) and Inland carrier (copy)
       
       In the context of the 'Guide to the scenario of EDIFACT
       container messages' (as referred to at the start of section 1)
       the following guidelines, rules and functionality apply to this
       Container gate-in/gate-out report message:
       
       *   The message contents can be uniquely identified by a
       combination of the following data elements:
       - ordering customer, coded (NAD)
       - ordering customer agent, coded (NAD)
       - container announcement reference (being the release order
       reference number or the acceptance order reference number)
       (RFF)
       
       The ordering customer agent, coded is needed to supplement the
       unique identification only in the next situation: the agent
       acts on behalf of several ordering customers issuing the same
       range of reference numbers for each customer.
       E.g. the ship's agent acts on behalf of several shipping lines
       issuing for each shipping line the same range of numbers.
       
       *   A copy of this message may be sent e.g. to the shipper,
       freight forwarder, the inland waterways and rail carriers,
       according to the communication addresses as mentioned in the
       Container announcement.
       
       *   One message may contain several containers.
       
       *   A supplementary container reference (container sequence
       number) is used to refer to the information of the container(s)
       in the Container announcement, if the container prefix and
       number was not completed in that message.
       
       *   An indicator for the transport status (i.e. export, import,
       transhipment or continental) is to be completed on container
       level (EQD-segment).
       
       *   One shipping line can be specified on message level.
       
       *   The seagoing vessel and sea voyage number can be specified
       on message level.
       
       *   Inland transport details can be specified for each
       individual container.
       
       *   For each container its place of discharge or its position
       of loading (stowage cell) in/on the means of inland transport
       can be specified.
       
       *   In case of export the port of discharge and any port of
       transhipment can be specified for each individual container.
       
       *   The date/time of pick-up and final address of positioning
       or the date/time of delivery must be given for each container.
       
       *   For each container seals can be specified affixed by the
       shipper, container freight station, terminal, sea carrier and
       Customs.
       
       The transport sub-working group (D4) has developed
       recommendations for a harmonised implementation of this message
       through its subgroup ITIGG (International Transport
       Implementation Guidelines Group).
       Users implementing the message are strongly advised to apply
       these recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4
       secretariat.
