General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Passenger
       list message (PAXLST) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration,
       commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       This Passenger List Message (PAXLST) permits the transfer of
       passenger/crew data from a Customs, Immigration or other
       designated authority in the country of departure to the
       appropriate authorities in the country of arrival of the means
       of transport.
       
       Where national privacy legislation permits, and with the
       agreement of all parties involved, this message may also be
       exchanged between carriers and Customs, Immigration, Police or
       any designated authorities.
       
       This transfer of data may occur upon departure from the sending
       agency and prior to arrival of the vessel/ flight at the
       receiving agency. This is to permit the designated authority at
       the place of destination to screen this data and take timely
       decisions related to the clearance of passengers and crew.
       
       The transfer of data may also occur prior to departure,
       carriers may transmit passenger listings to customs and
       immigration for pre-arrival clearance.
       
       Endorsement of this message by the Customs Cooperation Council
       does not necessarily mean endorsement by national Immigration
       or Police authorities, nor does it place any obligations on
       parties to apply the message.

1.2    Field of application

       The Passenger list message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.
       
       This message may be applied for international passenger
       movement and is not dependent on the mode of transport.

1.3    Principles

       It is envisaged that the message will:
       
       (a) facilitate the clearance of low risk passengers/crew.
       
       (b) allow Customs, Immigration or police authorities to more
       effectively and efficiently concentrate resources on areas of
       highest risk.

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment
       table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating
       requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole
       message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and
       implementation of the message:
       
        - Where a choice of code or text is given only the code
       element should be used wherever possible.
       
       - Data that is not necessary to meet the functional
       requirements of the message should not be included.
       
       - Free text information within the message should be avoided as
       this inhibits automatic processing.
