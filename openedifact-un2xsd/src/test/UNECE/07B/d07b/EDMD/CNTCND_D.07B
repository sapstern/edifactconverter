0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Contractual
       conditions message (CNTCND) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message sent by a customer to a supplier and other interested
       parties providing the contractual conditions of a previously
       negotiated contract in order to enable the automatic processing
       of invoices for orders which have been made against the
       contract or for the completion of identified stages within the
       contract.

1.2    Field of application

       The Contractual conditions message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       A Contractual conditions message is sent by a customer to a
       supplier and other interested parties in order to inform them
       of the contractual conditions which will be used in the
       validation of orders and in the verification of invoices prior
       to payment. 
       This message is typically used in the case where a general
       contract has been established between the customer and the
       supplier against which goods will be ordered over a period of
       time on an order by order basis. The contract will have been
       previously negotiated and accepted. This message only contains
       the information that can be used in automatically approving the
       issuance of an order or the correctness of an invoice. It is
       not intended to contain the totality of the contractual
       information.
