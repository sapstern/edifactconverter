0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Stowage
       instruction message (MOVINS) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A Stowage instruction message contains details of one means of
       transport vehicle, giving instructions regarding the loading,
       discharging and restowage of equipment and/or cargoes and the
       location on the means of transport where the operation must
       take place.

1.2    Field of application

       The Stowage instruction message may be used for both national
       and international applications. It is based on universal
       practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and
       is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       In the shipping industry the Stowage instruction message can be
       used between partners involved in the loading and discharging
       of vessels and other means of transport, like stevedores,
       shipping lines, tonnage centres, etc..
