0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the
       Classification information set message (CLASET) to be used in
       Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners
       involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The Classification information set message is designed to
       exchange tree structure or code lists and the links between
       them. These will be subsequently referred to as
       classifications. CLASET covers the transmission of general
       information on classifications, all or part of the content or
       structure of a classification, data maintenance operations on
       classifications, all or part of the links between
       classifications, and, any combination of the above.

1.2    Field of application

       The Classification information set message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       The acronym, CLASET, stands for Classification information set
       message and comprises a number of parts:
       i) Identification of administrative information concerning the
       interchange partners;
       ii) General information about the classification or the table
       of links sent such as the responsible agency, a historical list
       of the maintenance operations made on the classification or the
       table of links, subsequently referred to as events, or a
       generic property used to define attributes related to the
       classification or table of links;
       iii) Structure of the classification or table of links such as
       levels and items of a classification or relations contained in
       a table of links;
       iv) identification of the source and target objects of a link.
       For each structure component (level, item or link) or related
       component of a link, it is possible to attach generic
       properties and events. Events are also related to properties.
       The message has been designed in a generic way and provides
       mechanisms to describe the nature of the information exchanged
       within it. The message can be used to exchange requests and
       responses. This message will be used by organisation involved
       in data maintenance operations on classifications (e.g.
       compilers of classifications and maintenance agencies of code
       lists) and by users of classifications (e.g. statistical
       agencies, customs, enterprises making official declarations,
       administrations).
       Examples of tree structure or code lists are: official and
       statistical classifications, customs tariffs, organisation
       charts. Examples of links are correspondence tables between
       official classifications.

3.     TERMS AND DEFINITIONS

3.1    Standard terms and definitions

       See UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General
       Introduction, Section 2.

3.2    Message terms and definitions

       Data maintenance in the context of this message specification
       means the addition, deletion, or change to an object in a
       classification, such as the addition of an item, or the change
       to the description of an item.
