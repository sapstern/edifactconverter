0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Travel,
       tourism and leisure data update request - interactive message
       (TUPREQ) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       An interactive Travel, tourism and leisure data update request
       is sent by a supplier of a product or service to a global
       distribution system (GDS) to update the receiver’s data base
       for rates, availability, policy, and general information. It
       may also be used to initialize the receiver’s system with a new
       product or service. The message may also be sent by a GDS to a
       supplier when a travel agent has made updates to a traveller’s
       profile or a GDS needs to update an agency’s profile.

1.2    Field of application

       The Travel, tourism and leisure data update request -
       interactive message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       TUPREQ may be used for the following types of updates:
       
       (1) Update availability in the GDS system. May be sent when a
       single product is no longer available or may be a weekly or
       monthly update of availability for all services and products.
       
       (2) Update rates in the GDS system.  
       
       (3) Update policy or general information or a corporate account
       profile in the GDS system. This information may be at chain
       code or vendor level or for a specific product location.
       
       (4) Initialize a new product or service in the GDS system.
        
       (5) Update an agency or traveller profile in the supplier
       system.
       
       The message is made up of five distinct groups for updating the
       information listed above. The information shown in items 1-3
       can be sent as individual messages or a combination of the
       three groups can be sent in one message to the GDS. The data to
       initialize a new product or service or the update to an agency
       or traveller profile can not be sent with any other update.
       
       The message has the capability to tie an identification number
       to an individual update for purposes of reporting errors in
       TUPRSP, Travel, tourism, and leisure update response message.
       The sending of TUPREQ may be preceded by the sending of the
       Travel, tourism and leisure product application status request
       and response messages (PASREQ/PASRSP).  In this scenario a
       supplier would send PASREQ to a GDS to indicate what type of
       update is to be made and the number of records to be sent. The
       GDS would respond with the PASRSP to indicate if they can
       accept the update now or if it should be sent at a later date
       and what that date and time is. The GDS may also respond with
       how many records can be sent in one message. The supplier would
       then send TUPREQ at the specified time to update the GDS data
       base.
