0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Travel,
       tourism and leisure information inquiry response - interactive
       message (TIQRSP) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration,
       commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       An interactive Travel, tourism and leisure inquiry response is
       sent by a service provider in response to an information
       request for a product or service.

1.2    Field of application

       The Travel, tourism and leisure information inquiry response -
       interactive message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The request message, TIQREQ, for which TIQRSP is the response
       may be used to request lists of information or very detailed
       information. An initial request might request a list of hotel
       properties in a city. Based on the information returned, the
       next request in the scenario might ask for detailed information
       by specifying the item number for a specific property returned
       in the initial response. The next request might then ask for
       rule details from a list of rules specified in the previous
       response.
       
       TIQRSP may be used for the following functions within the
       interactive scenario for Travel, Tourism and Leisure (TT&L):
       
       (1) to respond to a request for a travel product or service in
       a specific city or geographical region. The response may
       include a list of products, such as a list of hotel properties
       in a city, a list of rental car locations, or schedule of
       trains.
       
       (2) to respond to a request for detailed information for a
       specific travel product. The response for information for hotel
       might include a description of the property, all the room
       types, recreation facilities at the hotel, transportation to
       the property, and points of interest close to the hotel.
       
       (3) to respond to a request for a specific type of information
       for a particular travel product. The response might be a list
       of the special equipment available for a car type, a list of
       facilities at a train station, or the rules concerning
       insurance coverage.
       
       (4) to respond to a request for corporate information for the
       supplier of a product or service. The response might include
       the promotions available to the traveller, the supplier's
       guarantee and deposit requirements, or the contact information
       for the vendor code.
