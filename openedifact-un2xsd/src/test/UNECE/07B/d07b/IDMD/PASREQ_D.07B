1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The Travel, tourism and leisure product application status
       request message is sent by either a service supplier to a
       product supplier to ask if the application or product is
       available for request or by a product supplier to a service
       supplier to notify them that they will not be receiving
       requests during a specified time period.

1.2    Field of application

       The Travel, tourism and leisure product application status
       request - interactive message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       PASREQ may be used for the following functions that facilitate
       the operation of the interactive scenario for travel, tourism
       and leisure:
       
       (1) to ask the supplier of a service or product if the
       application is available for requests. The request may specify
       an application, a message type, a scenario, and a dialogue
       type.
       
       (2) to notify a service supplier, such as a travel agent
       system, that they will not be taking requests for a specific
       application(s), message type, scenario, or dialogue type, or
       from specific agents based on location.
       
       (3) to ask the service supplier, such as a travel agent system,
       if they can send a message to update their data base.
