       An interactive Travel, Tourism and Leisure Reservations

       results of a reservations request for a Travel, Tourism and
       Leisure service. The Travel, Tourism and Leisure Reservation
       Request - Interactive message (RESREQ) is utilised to provide
       the interactive request to which the RESRSP is used to respond.

1.2    Field of application

       The Reservation response - interactive message may be used for
       both national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       RESRSP may be used for the following functions within the
       Interactive Reservations Scenario for Travel, Tourism and
       Leisure:
       
       (1) To respond to an initial reservation request for a hotel,
       rental car, train trip, airline flight, or tour.
       
       (2) To respond to a request to cancel, ignore, or modify a
       reservation.
       
       (3) To display a current or previously made reservation.
